))) CSES ADVANCE RELEASE - WHAT USERS NEED TO KNOW
===========================================================================

This dataset and all accompanying documentation is the "First Advance 
Release" of CSES Module 6 (2021-2026).

An Advance Release is a preliminary version of this CSES product. It thus 
lacks some of the checking, cleaning, processing, documentation, data, and 
variables that we anticipate in the Full Release of this product. The 
product is still in development, and data will be added gradually. Many 
election studies and variables that will eventually be present in the CSES 
Module 6 Full Release are unavailable in this file. Advance Releases are 
provided as a service to the CSES user community for those analysts who find 
it valuable to work with preliminary versions of the dataset. 

Users should anticipate future changes and improvements to the naming, data, 
and documentation of variables and election studies that appear in an 
advanced release file. If users wish to re-use their programming syntax/code 
on a future release of this product, we recommend that the code be written 
to accommodate these potential changes.

Users of the Advance Release may also wish to monitor the errata for CSES 
Module 6 on the CSES website to check for known errors that may impact their 
analyses. To view errata for CSES Module 6, go to Data Download on the CSES 
website, navigate to the CSES Module 6 download page, and click on the 
Errata link in the white box to the right of the page.

We hope that until the Full Release of CSES Module 6 is available, users 
will find this and future CSES Module 6 Advance Releases helpful in their 
work. 


===========================================================================
))) CSES DESIGN, DOCUMENTATION, & WEIGHTS - ADVICE TO USERS
===========================================================================

We recommend that researchers become familiar with the CSES design, units 
of analysis, documentation, and dataset weights before beginning their 
investigations. For instance, while the set of respondents appearing within
each election study represents their respective nations, the group of 
nations that appear within CSES is not a random sample of countries 
worldwide. Furthermore, while many election studies include 1,000 or so 
respondents, other election studies may consist of over 10,000 respondents. 
Some nations will have studies of more than one election in a CSES module,
and occasionally there will be two independent studies of a single 
election. Last, some election studies include over samples of specific 
sub-populations or would otherwise benefit from use of the included weight
variables. We hope you find our website and documentation useful as you 
proceed with your work, and welcome any questions or suggestions you have.


===========================================================================
))) OVERVIEW OF "CODEBOOK PART 2: VARIABLES DESCRIPTION"
===========================================================================

Part 2 of the CSES Codebook provides users with information about the 
variables in the CSES dataset as well as accompanying information about
each polity's election study. 


===========================================================================
))) HOW TO NAVIGATE THE CSES MODULE 6 CODEBOOK
===========================================================================

In the CSES MODULE 6 dataset, all variables begin with the letter "F" 
(F being the sixth letter of the English alphabet and thus signifying 
MODULE 6).

The CSES Codebook is especially extensive and users are advised that the 
best way to navigate it is electronically. It is a .txt format which 
allows it to be accessed via a variety of programs. 

In this part of the Codebook (Part 2), the headers for individual variables
are surrounded by two lines of dashes. For e.g., 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
VARIABLE NAME                  VARIABLE DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CSES Codebook can be navigated quickly in the electronic files, with 
the following commands allowing for quick searching:

))) = Section Header. 

>>> = Sub-section Header 1.

<<>> = Sub-section Header 2. 

+++ = Tables.

CSES QUESTION CLASSIFICATION = For survey level variables only, CSES  
Question Classification details whether the variable is part of the CSES  
Core component, which are questions asked repeatedly in CSES Modules, 
whether a variable is part of the CSES Module Theme component, which are  
questions specific to the Module Theme under exploration and might not be 
included in CSES repeatedly, or whether a variable is a Derivative Variable, 
which is explained below. 

VARIABLE NOTES = Notes for particular variables.

ELECTION STUDY NOTES = Notes for a particular election study.

DERIVATIVE VARIABLE = Highlights a variable derived from another variable or
variables within the CSES.

POTENTIAL POLITY LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = Highlights a variable that may
be used for data bridging at polity level.

POTENTIAL REGIONAL LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = Highlights a variable that  
may be used for data bridging at regional level.

POTENTIAL TIME BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = Highlights a variable that may be used
for data bridging by time.

POTENTIAL PARTY/COALITION LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = Highlights a variable 
that may be used for data bridging at party/coalition level.

POTENTIAL CSES PRODUCT BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = Highlights a variable that may
be used for data bridging with other CSES products.

For further details on the CSES MODULE 6 documentation, users are advised
to consult Part 1 of the CSES Codebook. 


===========================================================================
))) CSES CODEBOOK - VARIABLE NOTES AND ELECTION STUDY NOTES
===========================================================================

<<>> VARIABLE NOTES

Variable notes provide information on the rationale of a variable 
as well as source information for that variable. It also details the 
polities for which no data for that particular variable are available. 
VARIABLE NOTES are listed below the descriptive information for the said
variable and can be navigated in the Codebook by searching for 
"VARIABLE NOTES" in Part 2 of the CSES Codebook. 

<<>> ELECTION STUDY NOTES

A unique dimension of the CSES are the inclusion of ELECTION STUDY NOTES. 
They are notes which are attached to each variable included in the dataset
and refer to case-specific information regarding a particular variable. 
Their purpose is to provide users with more detailed information on the 
case or explain essential deviations specific to cases from CSES 
conventions. They are also used to provide source data information for 
users. Where applicable, ELECTION STUDY NOTES are listed below a particular
variable and any VARIABLE NOTES in Part 2 and 3 of the CSES Codebook. They
can be navigated in the Codebook by searching for "ELECTION STUDY NOTES" in
Parts 2-4 of the CSES Codebook.


===========================================================================
))) DERIVATIVE VARIABLES
===========================================================================

CSES MODULE 6 includes several derivative variables. A derivative variable 
is a variable that is derived from another variable or variables within the 
CSES. Their purpose is to facilitate speedier analysis for users with 
derivative variables capturing some of the most common analytical concepts 
in the discipline.

A list of the DERIVATIVE VARIABLES are below this explanation and can be
navigated in the Codebook by searching for DERIVATIVE VARIABLES in Part 2 
of the CSES MODULE 6 Codebook.

===========================================================================
))) CSES MODULE 6 CODING OF PARTIES/COALITIONS & LEADERS
===========================================================================

CSES codes parties/coalitions in its dataset numerically and alphabetically.
Below we provide explanations of both of these coding schemes. The details 
of each party/leader classification are available in Part 3 of the Codebook. 

<<>> CSES NUMERICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING

Each party is assigned a unique numerical code which consists of two 
components and six digits in total:
    - the first three digits indicate the numerical country UN code
    - the latter three digits indicate the numerical party code within
      the given election study.

All parties/coalitions or Presidential candidates, where applicable,
participating in the election or the previous election receive a numerical
code. These codes are used to identify the following: 
    - who a respondent voted for in the current election (variables F3011_).
    - who the respondent voted for in the previous election 
      (variables F3016_).
    - the respondent's party identification (variable F3023_3).
      
The numeric coding is also used to identify macro level information about
the parties/coalitions, namely: 
    - numeric party code identifiers for relational data (F5000_)
    - numeric party code identifiers for leaders' party affiliations
      (variables F5000_L_)
    - which party/coalition held the Presidency before and after the
      elections (variable F5019_1 and F5019_2).
    - which party/coalition held the Prime Ministership before and after
      the elections (variable F5020_1 and F5020_2).
    - which party/coalition held the ministry of finance before and after
      the elections (variable F5023_1 and F5023_2).
    - which party/coalition held the foreign ministry before and after
      the elections (variable F5023_3 and F5023_4).
    - which party/coalition held the health ministry before and after
      the elections (variable F5023_5 and F5023_6).

Numerical codes assigned to parties/coalitions are consistent for the 
current and previous election.  

<<>> CSES ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING
 
Parties A through F are the six most popular parties/coalitions, ordered in
descending order of their share of the popular vote in the parliamentary 
election (unless otherwise stated). Thus Party A is the party/coalition
that received the most votes in the election, party B the second most
votes, etc...

Parties/coalitions who achieve at least 1% of the vote nationally are
eligible for an alphabetical A-F assignment. In countries with multiple
electoral tiers and where one vote is cast, parties are ordered according
to their vote share in tier 1 (the lowest tier), unless otherwise stated.
In countries where voters have two votes (i.e., a constituency and a list
vote) simultaneously, for example Germany, parties are ordered by the
national share of the party list vote (tier 2).

Parties G, H, and I are supplemental parties. They may, but do not have to,
accord with how parties A-F are ordered, that is ordered on the popular 
share of the vote in a country. More often, they are codified in no 
particular order. These parties are voluntarily provided by each country's
election study and often reflect important or notable parties within a 
country. They may also include data about individual parties within a 
coalition, where data about the coalition and the individual parties, 
or some of these parties that make it up, are provided.
These codes are used to identify the following in the micro component of 
the CSES dataset: 
    - Respondent's likeability of the party/coalition (variable F3018).
    - Respondent's left-right placement of the party/coalition (variable 
      F3020).
    - Respondent's placement of the party/coalition on an alternative 
      scale, if applicable (variable F3021).

These alphabetical codes are used to identify district and macro level
information about these said parties/coalitions, namely:
    - The said party/coalition's vote share in the respondent's electoral
      district (variable F4004).
    - the said party/coalition's share of the seats in the election in the
      respondent's electoral district (variable F4005).
    - the said party/coalition's share of the vote in the election 
      (variables F5001, F5003, F5005, and F5006).
    - the said party/coalition's share of the seats in the election 
      (variables F5002 and F5004).
    - the said party/coalition's share of cabinet portfolios before and 
      after the election (variables F5021 and F5022).
    - expert judgments by the national Collaborators of the said party/
      coalition's ideological family (variable F5028).
    - expert judgments by the national Collaborators of the said party/
      coalition's left-right placement (variable F5029).
    - expert judgments by the national Collaborators of the said party/
      coalition's placement on an alternative scale, if applicable 
      (variable F5030).
    - expert judgments by the national Collaborators of the said party/
      coalition's level of populism (variable F5031).
    - The said party/coalition's Manifesto Research on Political 
      Representation (MARPOR/CMP) Identifier (variable F5200).
    - The said party/coalition's Parliaments and Government Database
      (ParlGov) Identifier (variable F5201).   
    - The said party/coalition's Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES) Identifier 
      (variable F5202).
    - The said party/coalition's Party Facts Identifier (variable F5203). 
 
<<>> CSES ALPHABETICAL LEADER CODING
         
Leaders A through F tend to be the leaders of the six most popular parties/
coalitions or the Presidential candidates of these parties. They correspond
to parties A-F (i.e., Leader A will be related to Party A in some way,
Leader B will be related to Party B, etc.).

Leaders G, H, and I are supplemental leaders. They may be related to
parties G, H, I, but they do not have to be. These leaders are voluntarily
provided by each country's election study and often include data about
additional personalities of interest. For example, in a parliamentary
system, data about a President might be provided, even if the Presidency
is not being contested. On many occasions, slots Leader G, H, and I will
include additional data for parties/coalitions that have multiple leaders.
These codes are used to identify the following in the micro and macro
components of the CSES dataset: 
    - Respondent's likeability of the leader/personality in question
      (variable F3019).
    - the said leader/personality's biological sex (F5000_L_ABS-IBS).


===========================================================================
))) CSES DATA BRIDGING: NEW FRONTIERS
===========================================================================

Data Bridging enables users to bring together information from CSES with 
other data sources. The concept is part of CSES Data Linkage efforts. CSES
has been a pioneer of Data Linkage with the inclusion of various 
macro-level data originating from other sources (e.g., The World Bank, 
the IDEA) directly in CSES data products, including in CSES MODULE 6. These 
macro data classify the political system's characteristics and contextual 
conditions of a polity at the election time.  
Data Bridging gives users the power to build on the direct data linkage 
in CSES products by enabling users to easily link other data with CSES 
products. CSES MODULE 6 enables users to bridge data with other prominent 
datasets in political science by including standard identifiers at the
polity, year, and party level used by other projects to facilitate 
merging.

CSES MODULE 6 facilitates data bridging with other datasets at the polity 
level with the following variables:
    - F1006_UN       ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN ISO_3166-1 NUMERIC CODE
    - F1006_UNALPHA2 ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN ISO_3166-1 ALPHABETIC
                                    TWO LETTER CODE
    - F1006_NAM      ID COMPONENT - POLITY NAME
    - F1007_VDEM     ID COMPONENT - V-Dem POLITY IDENTIFIER
    
More details can be found on all these variables in CSES Codebook Part 2
by searching for the variable name (e.g., "F1006_UN") or using the search
term "POTENTIAL POLITY LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER". 


CSES MODULE 6 facilitates data bridging with other datasets at the regional
level through the following variables:  
    - F1007_REG      ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS NUMERIC
                                    CODES
More details can be found on all these variables in CSES Codebook Part 2
by searching for the variable name (e.g., "F1007_REG") or using the search
term "POTENTIAL REGIONAL LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER". 


CSES MODULE 6 facilitates data bridging with other datasets by date through
the following variables:  
    - F1009          ID COMPONENT - ELECTION YEAR
    - F1010_M        DATE 1ST ROUND ELECTION BEGAN - MONTH
    - F1010_D        DATE 1ST ROUND ELECTION BEGAN - DAY

More details can be found on all these variables in CSES Codebook Part 2
by searching for the variable name (e.g., "F1009") or using the search
term "POTENTIAL TIME BRIDGING IDENTIFIER". 


CSES MODULE 6 facilitates data bridging with other datasets at the
party/coalition level with the following variables: 
    - F5200_A-I      MANIFESTO RESEARCH ON POLITICAL REPRESENTATION 
                     (MARPOR/CMP) IDENTIFIER - PARTY A-I
    - F5203_A-I      PARTY FACTS IDENTIFIER - PARTY A-I

by searching for the variable name (e.g., "F5200_A") or using the search
term "POTENTIAL PARTY/COALITION LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER."
Users can also see the specific bridging codes for each party/coalition
assigned an alphabetical code in CSES by other projects in Part 3 of the
CSES MODULE 6 Codebook.


CSES MODULE 6 facilitates data bridging with other CSES products at the
party/coalition level with the following variables:  
    - F6000_PR_1     IMD BRIDGING VARIABLE: CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL
                               ELECTION: VOTE CHOICE - 1ST ROUND

         | 
         | Conventionally, a CSES Module is intended to be administered 
         | during a consecutive period of five years. Given that most 
         | electoral cycles encompass a regular four to five year period, 
         | all polities included in CSES MODULE 6 Advance Release 1 fielded  
         | the Questionnaire once. 
         |
         | However, in some polities that experience more than one election 
         | in the 2021-2026 MODULE 6 administration period, CSES MODULE 6 
         | may be fielded twice. These polities will be listed here, once

         | A pandemic is an epidemic of infectious disease that has spread

         | substantial number of individuals.
         |                   
         | At the time of writing, COVID-19 was first discovered in November
         | 2019. Prior to the onset of CSES MODULE 6, the World Health 
         | Organization classified COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
         | On May 5, 2023, the WHO assessed that given the disease was by 
         | now well established and ongoing, it no longer fit the definition
         | of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and
         | hence the state of a global emergency.
         |                 
         | An election (or election study) in CSES MODULE 6 is classified 
         | as taking place during the COVID-19 pandemic if the election 
         | itself took place and/or the entire study fieldwork was 
         | administered before May 5, 2023, the end date of the WHO PHEIC
         | classification.
         | An election (or election study) is classified as taking place
         | entirely after the COVID-19 pandemic if the election was held and
         | the election study fieldwork was completed after May 5, 2023. 
         | An election which took place before May 5, 2023 but in which
         | the fieldwork took place both before and/or after May 5, 2023
         | is classified as an election taking place both after and during

         |   include self-administered components - for e.g. for questions 
         |   deemed sensitive. Self-administered parts interviewers give to 
         |   respondents as part of a face-to-face protocol are also known
         |   as computer-assisted self-interviewing (CASI).
         | - Telephone interviews are sometimes labeled computer-assisted 
         |   telephone interviews (CATI).
         | - Internet surveys are sometimes also referred to as computer-

         | In cases where a Collaborator provides a single weight that
         | is a combination of one or more of the three weight categories
         | (sample, demographic, and political), the weight is duplicated
         | in the two or more appropriate variables. Thus, analysts using
         | two or more of the weights simultaneously will need to account
         | for this duplication.
         |
         | Use of weights is at the discretion of the analyst based upon
         | the considerations of her/his individual research question.
         | We recommend that analysts familiarize themselves with the
         | weights, their components, and their methods of creation
         | before applying them.
         |
         | Additionally, analysts will want to keep in mind that these
         | weights are prepared to be election study weights, not country
         | weights. To convert the weights to country weights requires an
         | adjustment for those countries for which one or more polities
         | or election studies appear in the dataset.
         |
         | Where a weight of a particular type is unavailable, these
         | variables are coded 1.
         |
         | Collaborators provided the original weights with a varying
         | number of decimal places. In this CSES dataset, however, all
         | of the original weights have been rounded to four decimal places
         | at maximum (i.e. 1.1234) using STATA.
         |
         | Further details on the overall sampling design, including the 
         | weights deposited with CSES, are provided in the "Overview of 
         | Study Design and Weights" available for each election study in

         | Whereas all non-citizens (287 respondents from overall 3,556 
         | respondents) were dropped from the dataset for CSES Module 6, the 
         | weight calculation included these non-citizens. The explanation 
         | from the collaborators is that when they started their work on 
         | the file, they asked their statistician who devised the weights 
         | about this issue. His view was that they should leave the already 
         | calculated weight and a new weight was not necessary. The already 
         | supplied weight is adequate.

         | election studies, described in F1101_. They are the ratio of each
         | weighting factor to the mean weight (F1102_) of each type, 
         | calculated within each polity.
         |
         | The derivative "Polity Weight" (F1103_) has been created so
         | that for each weight (sample, demographic, political), each
         | respondent within the election study has a mean weight of "1".
         | If you are running a frequency, for instance, this weight
         | will work so that the N in your frequency table comes out to
         | approximately the same as the number of interviews in the
         | study. This derivative weight is created by dividing the
         | individual weight for each respondent within an election
         | study by the mean for that weight for all respondents in that
         | election study.
         |
         | To follow is the STATA code used to create variables
         | F1103_1, F1103_2, and F1103_3:
         |

         |
         | F1104 details the ratio of the average sample size to each 
         | election study sample. This factor is calculated on the basis of
         | the samples appearing in the CSES data files (i.e. does not
         | incorporate booster samples, panel respondents who did not
         | participate in the CSES wave of multi-wave studies, etc.). 
         | Further, this factor treats elections, and not political systems,
         | as the unit of analysis. Analysts wishing to compare across-
         | countries, instead of across-election studies, should adjust this
         | weight accordingly.
         |
         | The resulting factor is then used to create the derivative
         | "Dataset Weights" in variables F1105_1 through F1105_3.
         |
         | This variable will not be available until the Full Release of

         |
         | replace F1104 =  mean_res / n_cases
         | drop n-n_cases
         |

         | There is some inconsistency between studies in the way
         | the responses to the questions about current employment status
         | (F2006) affected the application of the follow-up occupation
         | variables (F2007-F2009). The CSES standard is that the
         | occupation variables are asked from those in labor force.
         | However, in some cases, for respondents categorized as not in
         | labor force in F2006 (codes 6-12) the occupation variables may
         | report respondent's last occupation. Hence, the responses
         | concerning occupation that belong to respondents not in labor
         | force presumably reflect their previous or last occupation.

         | (doctors, lawyers, etc.), employers, and trainees (with/without
         | renumeration). F2006 does not distinguish between these groups 
         | in the labor force, but classifies employed respondents based on 
         | a second question, in which respondents in the labor orce were 
         | fasked to specify their weekly working hours, as shown below.

         |
         | In the Turkish 2023 study, respondents' employment status was 
         | assessed by two successive survey questions. 
         | Respondents were first asked if they currently had a paid job, 
         | and if so, whether full-time or part-time. This first question 
         | distinguished between the following categories: 
         |   01. Employed - full-time (32+ hours weekly) (N = 558)
         |   02. Employed - part-time (15-32 hours weekly) (N = 15)
         |   03. Employed - less than 15 hours (N = 9)
         |   04. Helping family member (N = 14)
         |   05. Unemployed, employed in the past (N = 345)
         |   06. Unemployed, never worked (N = 552)
         | Categories 01. - 04. were used for coding F2006. Respondents 
         | without a paid job at the time of the interview (categories 05. 
         | and 06.) were supposed to be asked for further details on their
         | current situation in a follow-up question. However, due to a 
         | misspecified skip pattern, only the 552 respondents stating to 
         | never have been employed were asked the follow-up question. 
         | Hence, for the 345 respondents stating in the first question 
         | to have been employed in the past, further details on their 
         | current employment status are unavailable. These respondents 
         | are coded "13" in F2006.

         | VARIABLE NOTES: F2007
         |
         | F2007 details the respondent's main occupation; that is, the job
         | at which the respondent spends the most time or if the respondent
         | spends an equal amount of time on two jobs, it is the one from
         | which the respondent earns the most money.
         | For respondents who are currently employed, this variable reports
         | their current occupation. For respondents who are retired or not
         | currently working, F2007 reports respondent's last occupation.
         |
         | Coding conventions employ the first two digits of 2008
         | ISCO / ILO International Standard Classification of Occupations
         | Code from the International Labor Office, CH-1211, Geneva 22,
         | Switzerland.
         |
         | An English-language description of the ISCO-08 standard can be

         |
         | In some cases, it has not been possible to strictly adhere to the
         | two-digit ISCO/ILO conventions. Users will find that some 
         | categories have been added to the ISCO/ILO list in order to
         | accommodate the occupations of respondents who were not easily 
         | classified. These include categories referring to the first digit
         | of the 2008 ISCO / ILO occupations code. In these cases, zeros
         | were added to preserve the two-digit structure (e.g., 
         | 90. ELEMENTARY OCCUPATIONS [NOT FURTHER SPECIFIED]). Please 
         | refer to the Election Study Notes for clarification of the 
         | meaning of the additional codes.

         | Respondents' occupation was asked as an open-ended question -
         | "In as much detail as possible, please tell me, what is your
         | main occupation/professional activity? If you are currently
         | retired, unemployed, or disabled for work, list the last primary
         | occupation you previously held." Based on the answer,
         | interviewers assigned on the spot an ISCO code to the respondent.

         | VARIABLE NOTES: F2008
         |
         | The categories provided in F2008 are intended to distinguish 
         | among the following groups:
         |
         | 1. White Collar:
         | Broad occupational grouping of workers engaged in non-manual
         | labor: Managers, salaried professionals, office workers,
         | sales personnel, and proprietors are generally included in
         | the category.
         |
         | 2. Worker:
         | Broad occupational grouping of workers engaged in manual labor.
         |
         | 3. Farmer:
         | Normally persons self-employed in farming.
         |
         | 4. Self-Employed:
         | Self-employed occupations of all kinds, excluding self-employed
         | farming. Includes, for example entrepreneurs, shop keeper,
         | professionals like lawyers, medical doctors etc.
         |
         | There is some inconsistency between studies in the way
         | the responses to the questions about current employment status
         | (F2006) affected the application of the follow-up occupation
         | variables (F2008, F2009). The CSES standard is that the
         | occupation variables are asked from those in the labor force.
         | However, in some cases, for respondents categorized as not in
         | the labor force in F2006 (codes 6-12) the occupation variables
         | may report respondent's last occupation. Hence, the responses
         | concerning occupation that belong to respondents not in the
         | labor force presumably reflect their previous or last
         | occupation.
         |
         | Data on F2008 for respondents out of labor force are available
         | for BRAZIL (2022), DENMARK (2022), PORTUGAL (2022) and TURKIYE 
         | (2023).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BRAZIL (2022): F2008
         |
         | In the Brazilian 2022 study, F2008 was constructed from two
         | consecutive survey questions. The first question distinguishes 
         | between farmers/agricultural workers, blue-collar workers and 
         | white collars, irrespective of whether respondents were
         | self-employed or employees. For F2008, respondents were 
         | classified as self-employed if they specified to be 
         | self-employed in a separate question measuring their
         | employment type. Farmers were classified as "3" in F2008, 
         | irrespective of whether they stated to be self-employed or 
         | not.

         | quintiles).
         |
         | Where data were deposited in this format, income ranges shown 
         | are as originally reported by Collaborators including gaps 
         | between contiguous sets of ranges.
         |
         | Where deposited income data were not grouped into sample 
         | quintiles, the data have been recoded into quintiles, according
         | to sample proportions (not national statistics). For cases where
         | it was not possible to compute sample quintiles, the income 
         | categories approximating sample quintiles the closest have been
         | used. Consequently, this variable may contain distributions that
         | do not really represent quintiles.
         |
         | Depending on how the income data was deposited, the variable 
         | reports either monthly or annual income. The table below shows 
         | which of the two applies to the election studies:

         | In the 2023 Turkish election study, Collaborators asked 
         | respondents to name their monthly household income in an open 
         | question. However, 545 respondents refusing to name their 
         | income received a follow-up question, asking them to place their
         | income in one of seven categories. 
         | Income quintiles provided in F2010_1 are based on the continuous
         | data. For the 274 respondents for whom continuous data was not 
         | available but who answered the follow-up question, data were 
         | imputed by using the midpoint of their stated income category. 
         | For example, a respondent stating to have a monthly household 
         | income between 5,001 and 7,000 TRY is assumed to have a 
         | household income of 6,250 TRY - thus falling into the first 
         | quintile.

         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitute the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table below 
         | specifying the main election for each study in CSES for specific

         | VARIABLE NOTES: F3010_TS
         |
         | F3010_TS is constructed based on the respondent's reported
         | turnout in the current and previous main elections.
         | In polities where multiple elections took place simultaneously,
         | F3010_TS reports the turnout decision in the main election.
         | The classifications of the main election by election study are
         | listed in the variable notes for variable F3010_ME.
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime 
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitute the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table listed in
         | VARIABLE NOTES for F3010_ME specifying the main election for 
         | each study in CSES for specific details.
         |
         | In instances when the previous turnout refers to a different type 
         | of election, e.g., current main elections are Presidential but
         | previous turnout variable refers to lower house election only,
         | these studies are set to missing for F3010_TS.

         | CSES QUESTION CLASSIFICATION: DERIVATIVE VARIABLE (BASED ON CORE)
 
         | VARIABLE NOTES: F3010_FTV
         |
         | F3010_FTV ascertains whether or not the respondent is a 
         | first-time voter in the current main election.
         | Following the ACE Electoral Knowledge Network, CSES defines
         | first-time voters as "those young people who are reaching voting
         | age and therefore are facing their first opportunity to vote"
         | in the main election.
         | (see https://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/ve/vee/vee05/vee05h,
         | Date accessed: April 02, 2024).
         |
         | Consequently, F3010_FTV classifies observations as first time
         | voters based on respondent age (variable F2001_Y).
         |
         | Respondents are classified as "1. R IS A FIRST-TIME VOTER" if
         | they attained voting age between the dates of the previous and
         | current main election.
         | Respondents who were eligible at the preceding main election are
         | coded "0. R IS NOT A FIRST-TIME VOTER".
         |
         | As CSES collects respondents' year and month of birth only (for 
         | further information see VARIABLE NOTES for F2001_Y), there are a
         | few instances in the dataset that could not be classified based 
         | on the above definition and are hence coded "6. NOT 
         | ASCERTAINABLE". This applies to the following observations:
         | - Respondents who reached voting age in the month of the
         |   previous main election.
         | - Respondents who reached voting age in the year of the previous
         |   main election and for whom data on the month of birth is
         |   unavailable.
         |
         | Data are coded "9. MISSING" primarily in instances where
         | respondents' year of birth (F2001_Y) is unavailable.
         |
         | In polities where multiple elections took place simultaneously,
         | this variable classifies first voters based on the main election.
         | The classifications of the main elections by election study are
         | listed in the VARIABLE NOTES for variable F3010_ME.
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitute the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is

         | There are two different types of preference vote. The first is
         | associated with open PR-List systems. These systems allow  
         | citizens to vote for a party list and to mark a "preference" for 
         | one or more candidates within the party list. In these systems,
         | this type of vote is known as a preference vote (or a candidate 
         | vote). The second is associated with STV and AV systems, where
         | citizens rank-order candidates in descending order of their
         | preference. In these systems, a distinction is made between a
         | voter's first preference (i.e., who voters allocate their
         | "number 1" preference to) and their subsequent lower preferences.
         | These latter preferences (i.e., all the voter's preferences aside
         | from their first preference) are also known as preference votes.
         | We distinguish between these two different types of preference
         | votes in the above categorization. 
         |
         | In party list systems, the question asked of respondents should 
         | read like this: 
         | "Did you simply vote for a party or did you also express a 
         | candidate preference?"
         |
         | In party list systems where voters have to vote directly for a 
         | candidate and cannot cast a vote for the party list only (e.g., 
         | Estonia, Finland, and Poland), the question asked of respondents 
         | should read like this: 
         | "Do you consider the vote that you cast merely a vote for the 
         | party, or did you also mean it as a vote for a particular 
         | candidate?"
         |
         | In STV/AV systems, the question asked of respondents should be 
         | akin to this: 
         | "Which of the parties/candidates did you give your preference 
         | vote to?"
         | or 
         | "To whom did you give your second (or lower) preference vote to?"
         |
         | Respondents that mentioned not casting a ballot in the current
         | lower house election (F3010_LH) but reported a preference vote

         | For more detailed information on how CSES codes 
         | parties/coalitions, please see Part 3 of the CSES Codebook. 
         |
         | There are two different types of preference vote. The first is
         | associated with open PR-List systems. These systems allow 
         | citizens to vote for a party list and to mark a "preference" for 
         | one or more candidates within the party list. In these systems,
         | this type of vote is known as a preference vote (or a candidate 
         | vote). The second is associated with STV and AV systems, where
         | citizens rank-order candidates in descending order of their
         | preference. In these systems, a distinction is made between a
         | voter's first preference (i.e., who voters allocate their
         | "number 1" preference to) and their subsequent lower preferences.
         | These latter preferences (i.e., all the voter's preferences aside
         | from their first preference) are also known as preference votes.
         | We distinguish between these two different types of preference
         | votes in the above categorization. 
         |
         | In party list systems, the question asked of respondents should 
         | read like this: 
         | "Did you simply vote for a party or did you also express a 
         | candidate preference?"
         |
         | In party list systems where voters have to vote directly for a 
         | candidate and cannot cast a vote for the party list only (e.g., 
         | Estonia, Finland, & Poland), the question asked of respondents 
         | should read like this: 
         | "Do you consider the vote that you cast merely a vote for the 
         | party, or did you also mean it as a vote for a particular 
         | candidate?"
         |
         | In STV/AV systems, the question asked of respondents should be 
         | akin to this: 
         | "Which of the parties/candidates did you give your preference
         | vote to?"
         | or 
         | "To whom did you give your second (or lower) preference vote to?"
         |
         | Respondents that mentioned not casting a ballot in the current
         | upper house election (F3010_UH) but reported a vote choice are
         | included as it is not possible to identify why this 
         | inconsistency occurred. Users may identify these cases by 
         | cross-tabulating F3010_UH and F3011_UH_PF in their statistical 
         | software.

         | CSES QUESTION CLASSIFICATION: DERIVATIVE VARIABLE (BASED ON CORE)

         | VARIABLE NOTES: F3011_OUTGOV
         |
         | F3011_OUTGOV ascertains whether or not the respondent cast a 
         | ballot for the outgoing incumbent, regardless of whether or not 
         | it was valid. 
         |
         | In case of a single election taking place, e.g., a lower house
         | election only, F3011_OUTGOV reports the voting decision for
         | that particular election. In cases where multiple elections took 
         | place, e.g., a Presidential and a lower house election, 
         | F3011_OUTGOV reports the voting decision in the main election. 
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitute the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table below
         | specifying the main election for each study in CSES for specific 
         | details.
         |
         | In case of a Presidential election as main election, F3011_OUTGOV
         | refers to the incumbent President and/or the incumbent 
         | President's party. In all other cases, F3011_OUTGOV refers to 
         | the party/parties which was/were part of the outgoing cabinet. 
         | 
         | In mixed electoral systems where voters have a list vote and a 
         | district candidate vote, the list vote was used to determine if 
         | the respondent voted for the outgoing government or not.
         |
         | In case of a caretaker government, e.g., after a collapse of the
         | government, the party affiliations of its (remaining) members 
         | were used to code F3011_OUTGOV. Cabinet members without a formal 
         | party affiliation were not considered for F3011_OUTGOV.
         | 
         | Respondents who reported to have cast an invalid ballot are coded
         | as "0. DID NOT VOTE FOR THE OUTGOING GOVERNMENT (INCUMBENT)."

         | For Brazil 2022, respondents are coded as having voted for the 
         | incumbent if they voted for Jair Bolsonaro's platform, the 
         | Liberal Party (PL), in the current Presidential election. 
         | Bolsonaro contested the previous 2018 election as a candidate of 
         | the Social Liberal Party (PSL) but left the party in 2019 - 
         | joining the PL in November 2021. 
         | The PSL merged with the Democrats (DEM) to form Brazil Union 
         | (UNIAO, PARTY E) in October 2021.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - MONTENEGRO (2023): F3011_OUTGOV
         |
         | For Montenegro 2023, F3011_OUTGOV classifies vote for the 
         | incumbent government at the 2023 election, that is, votes for 
         | parties holding ministries in Dritan Abazovic's cabinet.
         | After Zdravko Krivokapic, Prime Minister since the previous 
         | 2020 legislative elections, was ousted in a motion of no 
         | confidence in February 2022, the Montenegrin parliament elected 
         | Abazovic (URA) as Prime Minister in April of the same year. 
         | However, Abazovic lost a motion of confidence himself after less
         | than four months in office on August 20, 2022. He remained acting
         | Prime Minister until the 2023 elections, with the following 
         | parties holding posts in his cabinet ahead of the election: 
         |
         | - United Reform Action (URA, PARTY D, NUMERICAL CODE 499004)
         | - Democrats (PARTY I, NUMERICAL CODE 499099)
         | - Bosniak Party (BS, PARTY E, NUMERICAL CODE 499005)
         | - Socialist People's Party (SNP, PARTY F, NUMERICAL CODE 499006)
         | - Croatian Civic Initiative (HGI, NUMERICAL CODE 499012)
         |
         | Voters for any of these parties or their associated electoral 
         | coalitions for the 2023 election are classified as having voted 
         | for the incumbent government. However, researchers are advised 
         | that the SNP (PARTY F) participated in an electoral coalition 
         | with the Democratic Alliance (DEMOS, NUMERICAL CODE 499016) in
         | the 2023 election. DEMOS did not hold any government portfolio 
         | in the outgoing government.
         | Further, the Albanian Alternative (AA) held one ministry before 
         | the 2023 election. As none of the respondents indicated to have 
         | voted for the AA's electoral coalition, the Albanian Forum, 
         | in the current election, that incumbent party is disregarded 
         | for F3011_OUTGOV.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PORTUGAL (2022): F3011_OUTGOV
         |
         | Portuguese 2022 snap elections were called when the budget,
         | proposed by the Socialist minority government was rejected in
         | the Parliament. The Left Bloc (BE) and the Portuguese Communist
         | Party (PCP), both of whom had previously supported the
         | government, joined the center-right to right-wing opposition
         | parties and rejected the budget. After that, the Portuguese
         | President announced a snap election.
         | Thus, F3011_OUTGOV was only coded as "1. VOTED FOR THE OUTGOING
         | GOVERNMENT (INCUMBENT)" for those respondents who voted for 
         | PARTY A, the Socialist Party (NUMERICAL CODE 620001) in

         | VARIABLE NOTES: F3011_VS_1
         |
         | F3011_VS_1 ascertains whether or not the respondent reports 
         | voting for the same party/coalition in the current and previous
         | election or whether the respondent reports voting for a different
         | party/ coalition in the current election from the previous 
         | election. 
         | F3011_VS_1 is constructed based on the respondent's reported
         | vote choice in the current and previous main election.
         | In polities where multiple elections took place simultaneously,
         | F3011_VS_1 reports the vote-switching behavior in the main 
         | election.
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitute the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table listed in
         | VARIABLE NOTES for F3010_ME specifying the main election for 
         | each study in CSES for specific details.
         |
         | Respondents are classified as "0. DID NOT SWITCH" when they
         | expressed a vote choice for the same party/coalition in the
         | current and previous election. In instances where a coalition is
         | competing in the current or previous election, and the parties
         | that comprise that coalition are competing individually in the
         | previous/current election, respondents who report voting for
         | the coalition and/or one of the parties comprising the coalition
         | are classified as "0. DID NOT SWITCH." Details of these cases
         | are specified in ELECTION STUDY NOTES below. 
         |
         | Respondents are classified as "1. SWITCHER" when their reported
         | vote in the current election differs from their reported vote 
         | in the previous election. Further, respondents are classified as
         | "1. SWITCHER" when they report voting in one election (current
         | or previous) for a party/coalition that did not exist or
         | contest in the other (current or previous) election.
         |
         | Respondents are classified as "9. MISSING" when data about
         | their vote choice in the current and/or previous election is
         | unavailable, if they report that they don't know who they
         | voted for, or if they refused to answer the question. 
         | Additionally, respondents who report voting for an independent  
         | candidate or other parties without further specification are 
         | classified as "9. MISSING."
         | In instances where current and previous vote choice refer to 
         | different types of elections, e.g., a current main election is
         | Presidential but previous vote choice refers to the lower
         | house election only, these studies are set to "9. MISSING".

         | Two Presidential candidates changed party affiliations between 
         | the previous 2018 election and the current 2022 election, 
         | namely:
         | Jair Bolsonaro (LEADER B) contested the previous 2018 election 
         | as a candidate of the Social Liberal Party (PSL, NUMERICAL CODE 
         | 076033) but left the party in 2019 - joining the Liberal Party 
         | (PL, PARTY B, NUMERICAL CODE 076002) in November 2021.
         | Geraldo Alckmin (LEADER G) contested the previous 2018 election 
         | for the Brazilian Social Democratic Party (PSDB, PARTY F, 
         | NUMERICAL CODE 076012) but left the party in 2021 to join the 
         | Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB, PARTY G, NUMERICAL CODE 076013).
         | In 2022, Alckmin contested on the Workers' Party ticket (PT, 
         | PARTY A, NUMERICAL CODE 076001) as Lula da Silva's vice-
         | presidential candidate.
         | Researchers are advised that for Brazil, vote-switching 
         | behavior in F3011_VS_1 is based on respondents' party choice 
         | rather than candidate choice, to ensure a consistent approach 
         | with other studies. Hence, voters who voted for Bolsonaro's
         | Social Liberal Party in the previous election and for the 
         | Liberal Party in the current election are classified as 
         | "1. SWITCHER" in F3011_VS_1. 
         | Likewise, respondents voting for Alckmin's PSDB in the previous 
         | election and for the Workers' Party in the current election 
         | are classified as "1. SWITCHER" in F3011_VS_1.

         | advised that the For the Future of Montenegro alliance was 
         | supported by the following additional parties in the previous 
         | 2020 lower house election: Socialist People's Party (SNP, 
         | NUMERICAL CODE 499006), Movement for Changes (PzP, NUMERICAL

         | two parties participated in the People's Coalition in the 
         | 2023 election (DP-PCG-SCG-DSS, NUMERICAL CODE 499011).
         | Respondents who reported voting for For the Future of Montenegro 
         | in the previous election and for either this alliance, 
         | Movement for Changes or the People's Coalition in the current

         |
         | Aleksa and Dritan - Count Bravely! (Demokrate-URA, NUMERICAL 
         | CODE 499004) was an electoral coalition that was formed for the 
         | current lower house election. This coalition was composed of the 
         | following member parties: United Reform Action (URA, NUMERICAL 
         | CODE 499004) and Democratic Montenegro (Demokrate, NUMERICAL 
         | CODE 499099).
         | In the previous 2020 election, URA contested the election 
         | jointly with the Citizen's Union "Civis", forming the electoral 
         | coalition Civic Platform "In Black and White" (NUMERICAL CODE 
         | 499021).
         | Respondents who reported voting for the Civic Platform in the

         | 792002) but left the party in 2021 to form the Homeland Party 
         | (Memleket, PARTY D, NUMERICAL CODE 792004).
         | Researchers are advised that for Turkiye, vote-switching behavior
         | in F3011_VS_1 is based on respondents' party choice rather than
         | candidate choice, to ensure a consistent approach with other 
         | studies. Hence, voters who voted for the CHP in the previous 
         | election and for Memleket in the current election are classified

         | F3011_LR_CSES differentiates voters based on expert judgments
         | of the CSES Collaborators on the left-right ideology scale. 
         | Collaborators assign parties scores on an 11-point scale ranging
         | from "0. LEFT" to "10. RIGHT" for all parties assigned an 
         | alphabetical code by CSES. The expert judgment data by party 
         | are available in variable F5029_.  
         |
         | The coding of F3011_LR_CSES is based on F3100_LR_CSES. 
         | For F3100_LR_CSES, CSES linked the CSES Collaborator expert 
         | judgment with the reported vote choice of the respondent in the 
         | main election. A respondent who reports voting for a party/
         | candidate of PARTY A is assigned the value the CSES Collaborator 
         | gave to PARTY A in the said election on the left-right scale 
         | (and so on for PARTY B, PARTY C etc...). CSES reports these 
         | values in variable F3100_LR_CSES.          
         |
         | These scores provided in F3100_LR_CSES have then been 
         | re-classified for F3011_LR_CSES to establish whether a 
         | respondent voted for a leftist, center or rightist party/
         | candidate. Scores assigned by Collaborators are recoded into a 
         | trichotomy as follows:

         | In polities where multiple elections took place simultaneously, 
         | this variable reports the vote choice in the main election. 
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitute the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the

         | The classification is based on MARPOR's "RILE" index value

         | rightist party/candidate of a party based on the Manifesto
         | Research on Political Representation (MARPOR/CMP) data.
         | F3011_LR_MARPOR is based on the "RILE" index. The index was
         | developed by Laver and Budge (1992). It takes 24 categories (12
         | are defined as right-wing and 12 as left-wing) and subtracts the
         | sum of all right-wing items from the sum of all left-wing items.
         | The RILE index ranges from -100 (if a party only mentions left-
         | wing issues in its program) and +100 (if a party only mentions
         | right-wing issues in its program). However, these are the 
         | theoretical maximum and minimum values which are empirically
         | rare.
         |
         | More information about MARPOR/CMP data and the RILE index can 
         | be found at https://manifestoproject.wzb.eu/
         | (Date accessed: April 02, 2024).
         | 
         | The coding of F3011_LR_MARPOR is based on F3100_LR_MARPOR. 
         | For F3100_LR_MARPOR, CSES linked the MARPOR/CMP data with the 
         | reported vote choice of the respondent in the main election.
         | A respondent who reports voting for a party/candidate of PARTY A 
         | is assigned the value the MARPOR/CMP RILE index gives to PARTY A
         | in the said election (and so on for PARTY B, PARTY C etc...). 
         | CSES reports these values in variable F3100_LR_MARPOR.        
         |
         | These scores provided in F3100_LR_MARPOR have then been 
         | re-classified for F3011_LR_MARPOR to establish whether a 
         | respondent voted for a leftist/rightist party/candidate. RILE 
         | Scores assigned by MARPOR/CMP are recoded into a dichotomy as 
         | follows: 
         |
         |       F3011_LR_MARPOR         MARPOR RILE index

         |                    01.        0.01 - 100.0
         |
         | When a party scores 0.00 on the RILE index, that usually means
         | that there is not enough data on the dimensions available to 
         | construct a reliable RILE estimate. These cases have been set to
         | "9. MISSING".

         | In polities where multiple elections took place simultaneously,

         | each study in CSES for specific details.  
         |
         | CSES and MARPOR/CMP have different scopes of parties/coalitions 
         | in elections and thus corresponding values assigned to
         | parties/coalitions by CSES Collaborators may be unavailable in
         | MARPOR/CMP and vice versa. 
         | In this variable, the L-R classifications assigned by MARPOR/CMP 
         | (originally available in F3100_MARPOR) are transformed into a
         | dichotomous variable.
         | Meanwhile, the L-R classifications assigned by CSES Collaborators
         | (available in F3011_LR_CSES and originally in F3100_LR_CSES and
         | F5029_ respectively) are transformed into a three-category
         | variable. Consequently, users are advised that this results in
         | some parties/coalitions falling into different categorizations
         | on F3011_LR_CSES and F3011_LR_MARPOR.
         |
         | Users are advised that CSES and MARPOR/CMP sometimes classify
         | coalitions differently in elections and across polities. For
         | example, CSES sometimes has data solely on coalitions and not 
         | the parties comprising the alliance, while MARPOR/CMP may have 
         | data concerning the individual parties in the coalition, or 
         | vice versa. Consequently, some parties may have multiple 
         | identifiers within the MARPOR/CMP dataset across time. A non 
         | comprehensive list of these deviations is noted in Part 3  
         | of the CSES Module Codebook in ELECTION STUDY NOTES.  
         |         
         | In certain elections, there can be little intra-study variation  
         | on this variable as all the main parties (i.e., those receiving 
         | most votes) are classified in one category (e.g., they are
         | all designated by MARPOR/CMP to have minus scores, and 
         | consequently, all are deemed to be on the left of the ideological
         | spectrum). 
         | Intra-study variation can be obtained by consulting variable 
         | F3100_LR_MARPOR. 
         |         
         | Data are unavailable primarily because some polities which are

         | Members of Brazil's lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, are 
         | elected from 27 multi-member districts by open list proportional

         | Collaborators assessed vote choice for the lower house with an

         | deputy in the 2018 election?". Interviewers were instructed to 
         | document all the details the interviewee remembered about their 
         | vote choice, such as the candidate's name and party affiliation.
         | This information was categorized by collaborators and used to 
         | code F3016_LH_PL.

         | Members of the Brazilian Senate (Senado Federal) serve a term of

         | Each of Brazil's federative units (N = 27) has three Senators, 
         | such that the total N of seats is 81 (27 x 3). 
         | Two thirds of the seats (N = 54) are contested in one electoral 
         | cycle, while the remaining one-third are contested in the other.
         | As the previous 2018 elections saw two-thirds of the seats 
         | contested, voters had two votes in this election (two Senators 
         | per state were being selected). Votes for these two seats per 
         | state are classified in F3016_UH_DC_1 and F3016_UH_DC_2. However,
         | as the current 2022 election had one seat contested per state,

         | F3100_LR_CSES assigns respondents a score based on respondents' 
         | reported vote choice and the corresponding expert judgment 
         | of the CSES Collaborators on the left-right ideology scale for 
         | the party the respondent reports voting for.        
         | Collaborators assign parties scores on an 11-point scale ranging
         | from "0. LEFT" to "10. RIGHT" for all parties assigned an 
         | alphabetical code by CSES. The expert judgment data by party 
         | is available in variable F5029_.
         |
         | Some parties/coalitions have scores that are not round numbers,
         | e.g., 1.5 or 3.5. These scores can reflect Collaborator
         | judgments or reflect the classification of a coalition. 
         | Sometimes respondents report voting for a coalition, but
         | Collaborators score parties that comprise this coalition
         | separately on the L-R scale. The score used for F3100_LR_CSES
         | is the mean of L-R scores of parties that comprise the given
         | coalition. 
         | All of these instances are detailed in ELECTION STUDY NOTES 
         | below.        
         |
         | F3100_LR_CSES links the CSES Collaborator expert judgment with  
         | the reported vote of the respondent in the main election. Here, 
         | a respondent who reports voting for a party/candidate of PARTY A
         | is assigned the value the CSES Collaborator gave to PARTY A in 
         | the said election on the left-right scale (and so on for PARTY B, 
         | PARTY C etc...). 
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitutes the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data

         | & LEADERS" in Codebook Part 3. 
         |
         | F3100_LR_MARPOR assigns respondents a score based on respondent 
         | reported vote choice and the corresponding value of that party 
         | on the MARPOR "rile" index. The index was developed by Laver and
         | Budge (1992). It takes 24 categories (12 are defined as right-
         | wing and 12 as left-wing) and subtracts the sum of all right-wing
         | items from the sum of all left-wing items. The RILE index ranges
         | from -100 (if a party only mentions left-wing issues in its 
         | program) and +100 (if a party only mentions right-wing issues in
         | its program). However, these are the theoretical maximum and 
         | minimum values which are empirically rare.

         |
         | F3100_LR_MARPOR links the MARPOR "rile" index value with the

         | is assigned the value MARPOR "rile" index gave to PARTY A in
         | the said election (and so on for PARTY B, PARTY C etc...). 
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime

         |
         | Users are advised that CSES and MARPOR/CMP sometimes classify 
         | coalitions differently in elections and across polities. For
         | example, CSES sometimes has data solely on coalitions and not 
         | the parties comprising the alliance, while MARPOR/CMP may have 
         | data concerning the individual parties in the coalition, or 
         | vice versa. Consequently, some parties may have multiple 
         | identifiers within the MARPOR/CMP dataset across time. A non      
         | comprehensive list of these deviations is noted in Part 3  
         | of the CSES MODULE 6 Codebook in ELECTION STUDY NOTES.
         |         
         | Data are unavailable primarily because some polities, which are

         | This variable hence links the CSES Collaborator expert judgment

         | "Definition: Populism can be defined as a thin-centered ideology
         | that pits a virtuous and homogeneous people against a set of 
         | elites and dangerous 'others' who are depicted as depriving
         | "the people" of their rights, values, prosperity, identity, and
         | voice. The emphasis on anti-elite/ anti-establishment rhetoric 
         | and the contrast between the "pure people" and the "corrupt 
         | elite" are thus indications of the degree to which a party is 
         | populist. Populist parties can be found across the left-right 
         | ideological spectrum."
         |
         | F3100_POP_CSES is coded based on respondents' vote choice in the

         | VARIABLE NOTES: F3100_IF_CSES
         |
         | F3100_IF_CSES links the respondents' reported vote choice in the 
         | main election with the CSES Collaborators experts' judgment of 
         | the ideological family of the party the respondent reported 
         | voting for.
         |
         | F3100_IF_CSES is available for voters who reported voting for a 
         | party where expert judgments are available (i.e., for parties 
         | receiving an alphabetical classification by CSES). For more 
         | details on which parties/coalitions receive alphabetical 
         | classification see "CSES MODULE 6 CODING OF PARTIES/COALITIONS
         | & LEADERS" in Codebook Part 3. 
         |
         | F3100_IF_CSES assigns respondents a score based on respondent 
         | reported vote choice and the corresponding CSES Collaborators 
         | expert judgments of the party's ideological family.
         | The expert judgment data by party is available in variable
         | F5028_.      
         |
         | F3100_IF_CSES links the CSES Collaborator expert judgment with  
         | the reported vote of the respondent in the main election. Here, 
         | a respondent who reports voting for a party/candidate of PARTY A
         | is assigned the value the CSES Collaborator gave to PARTY A in 
         | the said election on the left-right scale (and so on for PARTY B, 
         | PARTY C etc...). 
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitutes the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table listed in
         | VARIABLE NOTES for F3010_ME specifying the main election for 
         | each study in CSES for specific details.       
         |
         | In some instances, CSES Collaborators provide additional 
         | information to the characterization, and when applicable, these 
         | are detailed in the ELECTION STUDY NOTES for variable F5028_.
         |
         | Users are advised that the same party might have been coded as 
         | belonging to different party families across different
         | elections. These differences may reflect actual changes in
         | parties' ideological positions across time. 
         | Alternatively, they might reflect disagreement on different 
         | experts on which ideological family the respective party 
         | belongs to, whenever national Collaborators changed between 
         | election studies. 
         |
         | Data are unavailable primarily because Collaborator expert 
         | judgments of parties were not provided for certain election
         | studies.

         | (1) Respondents' electoral districts are reported in F2019,
         |     with labels listed in Part 4 of the CSES Codebook.
         |
         | (2) According to the different types of elections included in
         |     this CSES release, the tables below provide an overview of 
         |     each polity and to which election the district data 
         |     pertains to, detail the number of districts in total in 
         |     each state and the number of these districts which are 
         |     sampled by studies included in CSES, and provide information
         |     about the electoral tier (where applicable) to which the 
         |     district data pertain to. Users are advised to consult these
         |     tables carefully to decide which data is appropriate for
         |     their analyses. 
         |
         | (3) In mixed systems, such as Germany or New Zealand, district 
         |     data refers to the constituency vote (as opposed to the 
         |     list-PR vote).
         |
         | (4) There are two versions of each district-level variable. 
         |     Most election studies are coded into F4001-F4007. For 
         |     polities that operate one nationwide electoral district,
         |     district data are coded into variables F4001_N-F4007_N

         |
         | F5012_1 details the electoral formula used to elect the President
         | when the President is elected by popular vote. Presidents 
         | indirectly elected (for example, those elected by Parliament) are 
         | classified as "7. NOT APPLICABLE". 
         |
         | Below, the classifications of each electoral formula are 
         | summarized: 
         |    - PLURALITY: The candidate that obtains the most votes wins.
         |    - ABSOLUTE MAJORITY RULE: A candidate must win over 50% of the 
         |      vote to win. If no candidate wins this many votes in  
         |      Round 1, then there is a runoff election (Round 2), 
         |      conventionally between the top two candidates.
         |    - QUALIFIED MAJORITY RULE: Each qualified majority system 
         |      specifies a particular percentage of the vote a candidate 
         |      must win in order to be elected in Round 1. If two or more
         |      candidates overcome these thresholds, then the one with the 
         |      highest number of votes wins. The qualified majority systems 
         |      vary regarding the electoral procedure that applies when 
         |      these thresholds are not met.
         |    - ELECTORAL COLLEGE: The candidate that wins a plurality 
         |      of the electoral college votes wins.
         |    - SINGLE TRANSFERABLE VOTE: Requires voters to rank single
         |      candidates in order of the most to least preferred. Votes 
         |      are transferred until candidates obtain the Droop quota. The
         |      candidate that obtains this quota first is elected. In 
         |      essence, this is the Alternative Vote as only one candidate 
         |      is elected.

         | MAJORITARIAN systems require successful candidates to win either
         | a plurality or majority of the vote. As a result, they are
         | considered majoritarian.
         |
         | MIXED systems use a mixture of majoritarian and proportional
         | electoral rules. A country can be classified as having a mixed
         | system whether it uses one or more electoral segments (tiers); in
         | practice, most mixed systems have more than one segment (tier).
         | Mixed electoral systems can be divided into those in which the
         | two electoral formulas are dependent and those in which they are
         | independent.         
         |
         | PROPORTIONAL systems can be divided into two types: those that 
         | use party lists and those like the single transferable vote that 
         | do not. Those systems employing lists can themselves be divided 
         | into two further categories: quota systems (with allocation of
         | remainders) and highest average systems.

         |
         | In CSES MODULE 5, classifications of political regimes mainly 
         | rely on the following decision rule as presented by Cheibub, 
         | 2007:
         | 
         | A. The system is parliamentary either (i) if there is no
         | independently (indirectly or directly) elected President or (ii)
         | if there is an independently (indirectly or directly) elected
         | President but the government is not responsible to the President.
         | B. The system is mixed either if there is an independently
         | (indirectly or directly) elected President and government is
         | responsible to the President.
         | C. The system is Presidential if the government is not 
         | responsible to the elected legislature.
         |
         | NOTE: Responsibility refers to whether the survival of the
         | executive depends directly on legislature (i.e., vote of
         | confidence).
         |
         | However, researchers are advised that in a small number of 
         | cases, coding employed in CSES MODULE 5 may diverge from regime 
         | classifications as suggested by Cheibub. 
         | Further, all polities included in CSES MODULE 5 are classified 
         | according to the above coding scheme, irrespective of their 
         | democratic status. Researchers interested in democracy ratings 
         | may refer to F5070_ (Freedom House) or F5071_ (Polity IV).

         | Portugal is coded here as "1. MIXED REGIME". Sometimes,
         | the country is also regarded as a parliamentary regime.
         | Following Cheibub (2007), Portugal is regarded as a mixed 
         | regime, as Portugal's President is directly elected
         | and the government is accountable to both Parliament and 
         | the President (Article 190 of the Constitution).

         | Furthermore, data refer to the main election, unless otherwise

         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitutes the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table listed in

         | Since 2002, French legislative elections have been held shortly 
         | after the Presidential elections, thereby decreasing the chances
         | of a divided government where the President has a different party
         | affiliation than the parliamentary majority (referred to as 
         | cohabitation). 
         | At the French 2022 Presidential elections in April, incumbent 
         | Prime Minister was Jean Castex. However, Castex resigned in May
         | ahead of the June 2022 legislative elections. Castex' successor
         | is Elisabeth Borne, classified here as Prime Minister after the 
         | election. Both Castex and Borne are affiliated with La Republique
         | En Marche (LaREM, PARTY A, NUMERICAL CODE 276001).

         |    Cabinet size is defined by the total number of ministers
         |    (persons, not posts) in a defined government. Ministers are
         |    considered members of a cabinet when they exercise voting
         |    rights. This number includes both ministers with and without
         |    portfolio and the Prime Minister, but excludes deputy 
         |    ministers, undersecretaries, parliamentary secretaries,
         |    ministerial alternates, given that in the majority of cases,
         |    they do not exercise full voting rights.
         | b) Presidential Regimes:
         |    Cabinet size is defined by the total number of ministers or
         |    secretaries who head a ministry.

         | (2023), F5021_ variables classify the French cabinet as of 
         | January 1, 2022, with a cabinet size of 41. However, researchers
         | are advised that there was a minor cabinet reshaping in March 
         | 2022, resulting in two ministers stepping down, with only one of
         | them being replaced. Hence, the size of the cabinet decreased
         | from 41 to 40 in March, until its dissolution on May 16, 2022.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - MONTENEGRO (2023): F5021_2

         | taken on additional ministerial powers during the COVID-19 
         | crisis, including the Treasury and Health portfolios. The

         | F5031_ details the expert judgment of the national Collaborators
         | as to where parties are located on a populism scale. 
         | Definition: Populism can be defined as a thin-centered ideology
         | that pits a virtuous and homogeneous people against a set of 
         | elites and dangerous 'others' who are depicted as depriving
         | "the people" of their rights, values, prosperity, identity, and
         | voice. The emphasis on anti-elite/ anti-establishment rhetoric 
         | and the contrast between the "pure people" and the "corrupt 
         | elite" are thus indications of the degree to which a party is 
         | populist. Populist parties can be found across the left-right 
         | ideological spectrum.
         |
         | Sometimes, parties' levels of populism are hard to determine. 
         | These instances are detailed in ELECTION STUDY NOTES below.

         |
         | For lower house elections, Australia employs the Alternative 
         | Vote system. In this system, voters are required to list their
         | preferences for as many candidates as there are on the ballot. 
         | Thus, while the number of votes cast is one, the number of 
         | preferences expressed varies across electoral districts.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRALIA (2022): F5051_3
         | 
         | For upper house elections, Australia employs a single-
         | transferable-vote form of proportional representation. In this
         | system each voter indicates the order of preference among all 
         | the candidates in competing in her district, or alternatively, 
         | she can indicate support for a party ticket (which determines 
         | the order of preference of candidates within the party).

         | Members of the Brazilian Senate (Senado Federal) are elected
         | for an 8-year term, and the chamber is composed of 81 members, 
         | with each state in Brazil having three Senators each. 
         | Members are elected in alternative electoral cycles: two-thirds 
         | of the Senate seats (n=54) are contested in one election cycle 
         | while the remaining one-third are contested in the other. The 
         | 2022 elections saw one-third of the Senate seats contested. 
         | Accordingly, voters therefore had one vote in this election, as
         | one Senator per State was being elected.

         | The Danish Folketing has 179 members, 175 of which are elected
         | in mainland Denmark and the remaining four from the territories
         | of Greenland and the Faeroe Islands. In mainland Denmark, 135 
         | members are elected from 10 multi-member constituencies across
         | three geographical regions, namely: Copenhagen, Northern Jutland, 
         | and Seeland-Southern Denmark. Additionally, 40 supplementary 
         | seats are distributed across these three geographical regions  
         | in order to achieve full proportionality. While voters do not 
         | cast a ballot directly for this tier, it is widely acknowledged
         | to constitute a separate tier of the electoral system.

         |   011. The conduction of the pandemics by Jair Bolsonaro was a 
         |        major factor in his defeat. In a country that has a 
         |        specialized program for vaccination throughout the 
         |        country and a high rate of adherence to vaccines, 
         |        Bolsonaro chose to deny the seriousness of the COVID-19
         |        virus, encouraged people to return to their daily 
         |        activities and neglected the purchase of vaccines. Thus,
         |        in addition to the various statements contrary to 
         |        scientific guidelines, the President delayed the 
         |        country'svaccination. The pandemic caused 800,000 deaths
         |        in the country. The evaluation of his government was 
         |        particularly affected during the period. There is also 
         |        the impact of the pandemic on the country's economic 
         |        performance. The country did not do well in the first 
         |        year of Bolsonaro's government and, under the pandemic, 
         |        the economic rates only got worse. At the end of his 
         |        administration, the Bolsonaro government had the second 
         |        worst average annual GDP growth since Fernando Henrique
         |        Cardoso in 1995: 1.4%.
         |
         |   012. After being arrested and therefore prevented from 
         |        disputing the 2018 elections, former President Luis 
         |        Inacio Lula da Silva (Lula) had criminal convictions 
         |        against him annulled, teeing up a Presidential run 
         |        against current President Jair Bolsonaro in 2022. Lula, 
         |        who was leading the voter intention as early as 2018, 
         |        returned to prominence in the Presidential elections four
         |        years after his arrest. In a candidacy that brought 
         |        together several parties and experienced politicians, 
         |        Lula and the Workers' Party defined an alliance strategy
         |        with sectors of the center, and the candidacy of one of 
         |        the main leaders of the Social Democracy Party 
         |        constituted his candidacy as vice-President, softening 
         |        the still present image of Lula as a radical left 
         |        politician. Lula was joined by Geraldo Alckmin, his 
         |        former PSDB competitor, as vice-President.
         |
         |   013. Jair Bolsonaro's constant attacks on the Supreme Court 
         |        eroded the image of the then President. Bolsonaro 
         |        frequently threatened Brazilian democracy, expressing his
         |        non-acceptance of the election result if defeated and 
         |        raising the possibility of a coup d'etat. Brazil was even
         |        considered by V-Dem to be one of the countries that most 
         |        advanced towards an autocracy under the Bolsonaro 
         |        government.
         |
         |   014. In this sense, Bolsonaro also encouraged distrust of the 
         |        fairness of the elections. Since his first victory as 
         |        President in 2018, the politician has accused fraud via
         |        electronic ballot boxes for the results. The dissemination
         |        of false information, such as this one about electronic 
         |        ballot boxes, was one of the incentives for the Supreme 
         |        Court to enter an alliance with WhatsApp to combat fake 
         |        news during Brazilian elections. The speeches clearly had
         |        consequences: the director of the Federal Highway Police 
         |        (PRF) commanded actions, mainly in the Northeast (the 
         |        Workers' Party's main electoral stronghold), so that 
         |        buses with voters did not arrive at the polling station. 
         |        After Lula's victory, hundreds of highways were closed by
         |        protests against the result of the polls. During the 
         |        election, Bolsonaro made serious threats to the Electoral
         |        Court and the minister of justice and called for popular 
         |        unrest. Many analyses compare Bolsonaro's attitudes with 
         |        Trump's attitudes in the USA. It is worth mentioning that
         |        on January 8, 2023, after Lula's victory, the buildings 
         |        of the National Congress, the Federal Supreme Court and 
         |        the Executive Branch were invaded and vandalized, 
         |        demonstrating the serious threat to democracy from the 
         |        Bolsonaro bases.
         | 
         |   015. The "anti-establishment" movement, which basically brought
         |        new political actors to the elections, lost its strength. 
         |        The coalition elected with Lula was a strong response to 
         |        the movement that Bolsonaro is part of. The Workers' 
         |        Party candidacy attracted several political elites from 
         |        different ideological spectra to support Lula and thus 
         |        brought resistance to Jair Bolsonaro's candidacy, seen as
         |        a threat to the democratic regime.

         | Definition: F5096_ detail the World Bank estimate of Central 
         | government debt. Debt is the entire stock of direct government
         | fixed-term contractual obligations to others outstanding on a
         | particular date. It includes domestic and foreign liabilities
         | such as currency and money deposits, securities other than
         | shares, and loans. It is the gross amount of government
         | liabilities reduced by the amount of equity and financial
         | derivatives held by the government. Because debt is a stock
         | rather than a flow, it is measured as of a given date, usually 
         | the last day of the fiscal year.

         | Definition: A pandemic is an epidemic of infectious disease that 
         | has spread across a large region or multiple or worldwide and 
         | affecting a substantial number of individuals.   
         | At the time of writing, COVID-19 was first discovered in November
         | 2019. However, it is possible human-to-human transmission of the
         | disease was occurring before this discovery. On January 11, 2020
         | the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified by Chinese
         | authorities of a virus outbreak in Wuhan, China. On January 30,
         | 2020, the World Health Organization classified COVID-19 as a 
         | Public Health Emergency of Concern before eventually declaring 
         | the Health situation as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
         |         
         | Definition from WHO:
         | "From the 31 December 2019 to the 21 March 2020, the WHO  
         | collected the numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths  
         | through official communications under the International Health 
         | Regulations (IHR, 2005), complemented by monitoring the official 
         | ministries of health websites and social media accounts. 
         | Since 22 March 2020, global data is compiled through WHO 
         | region-specific dashboards, and/or aggregate count data reported 
         | to WHO headquarters.
         | Counts primarily reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, 
         | based upon WHO case definitions; although some departures may 
         | exist due to local adaptations. Counts include both domestic and 
         | repatriated cases. Case detection, definitions, testing 
         | strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ between 
         | countries, territories, and areas. These factors, amongst others, 
         | influence the counts presented with variable under or 
         | overestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays 
         | to reflecting these data at a global level."

         | in January 2020, spurring a series of endeavors to develop a 
         | vaccination to address the severe symptoms of the virus. 
         | Throughout 2020, several different polities and entities 
         | endeavored to create vaccines. On December 2, 2020, the United 
         | Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency temporarily
         | approved a COVID-19 vaccine, becoming the first polity to approve
         | and distribute a vaccine. This was quickly followed by European
         | Union and United States regulatory authorities, with vaccines 
         | becoming theoretically available to much of the world's 
         | population from 2021 onwards. However, the availability 
         | timeline varied considerably by polity. Consequently, for the 
         | years 2020 and before, CSES classified this variable as

         |
         | F5094_ details the cumulative N of COVID-19 vaccinations per 100  
         | reported to the weekend. F5094_ measures at three time points:  
         | the number of cumulative vaccinations per 100 reported at the  
         | week ending the week before the election (Time T); the number of 
         | cumulative vaccinations per 100 reported in a polity at the week 
         | end one year before the election date (Time T-1); and the number  
         | of cumulative vaccinations per 100 reported in a polity at the  
         | weekend two years before the election date (Time T-2).
         |
         | The genetic sequence underlying the COVID-19 virus was published
         | in January 2020, spurring a series of endeavors to develop a 
         | vaccination to address the severe symptoms of the virus. 
         | Throughout 2020, several different polities and entities 
         | endeavored to create vaccines. On December 2, 2020, the United 
         | Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency temporarily
         | approved a COVID-19 vaccine, becoming the first polity to approve
         | and distribute a vaccine. This was quickly followed by European
         | Union and United States regulatory authorities, with vaccines 
         | becoming theoretically available to much of the world's 
         | population from 2021 onwards. However, the availability 
         | timeline varied considerably by polity. Consequently, for the 
         | years 2020 and before, CSES classified this variable as 
         | "NOT APPLICABLE: VACCINE NOT WIDELY AVAILABLE."    
         |         
         | Definition: A pandemic is an epidemic of infectious disease that 
         | has spread across a large region or multiple or worldwide and 
         | affecting a substantial number of individuals.   
         | At the time of writing, COVID-19 was first discovered in November
         | 2019. However, it is possible human-to-human transmission of the
         | disease was occurring before this discovery. On January 11, 2020
         | the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified by Chinese
         | authorities of a virus outbreak in Wuhan, China. On January 30,
         | 2020, the World Health Organization classified COVID-19 as a 
         | Public Health Emergency of Concern before eventually declaring 
         | the Health situation as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
         |         
         | Definition from WHO:
         | "From the 31 December 2019 to the 21 March 2020, the WHO  
         | collected the numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths  
         | through official communications under the International Health 
         | Regulations (IHR, 2005), complemented by monitoring the official 
         | ministries of health websites and social media accounts. 
         | Since 22 March 2020, global data is compiled through WHO 
         | region-specific dashboards, and/or aggregate count data reported 
         | to WHO headquarters.
         | Counts primarily reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, 
         | based upon WHO case definitions; although some departures may 
         | exist due to local adaptations. Counts include both domestic and 
         | repatriated cases. Case detection, definitions, testing 
         | strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ between 
         | countries, territories, and areas. These factors, amongst others, 
         | influence the counts presented with variable under or 
         | overestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays 
         | to reflecting these data at a global level."

         | F6000_ detail respondents' vote choice in the current election -
         | if applicable and respondents cast a ballot - based on 
         | harmonized numeric identification codes applied in the CSES

         | data from all four completed CSES Modules. 
         |
         | By coding vote choice according to IMD standards, F6000_ 
         | variables thus ease appending the current version of CSES
         | MODULE 6 to the CSES IMD and thereby facilitate longitudinal
         | comparative research. 
         |
         | In CSES IMD, each party/coalition receives a unique numerical 
         | identifier that is consistent across modules. This seven-digit 
         | numerical identifier, on which coding for F6000_ is based, 
         | contains information on the polity and a unique numerical value 
         | to distinguish the party/coalition. Hence, numerical party/
         | coalition codes are harmonized across Modules within CSES IMD.  
         | For more detailed information on how CSES codes parties/
         | coalitions, please see Part 3 of the CSES IMD Codebook.
         |

         | POTENTIAL CSES PRODUCT BRIDGING IDENTIFIER
         |
         | F6000_ detail respondents' vote choice in the current election -
         | if applicable and respondents cast a ballot - based on 
         | harmonized numeric identification codes applied in the
         | CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD), a CSES data product 
         | including data from all four completed CSES Modules. 
         |
         | By coding vote choice according to IMD standards, F6000_ 
         | variables thus ease appending the current version of CSES
         | MODULE 6 to the CSES IMD and thereby facilitate longitudinal
         | comparative research. 
         |
         | In CSES IMD, each party/coalition receives a unique numerical 
         | identifier that is consistent across modules. This seven-digit 
         | numerical identifier, on which coding for F6000_ is based, 
         | contains information on the polity and a unique numerical value 
         | to distinguish the party/coalition. Hence, numerical party/
         | coalition codes are harmonized across Modules within CSES IMD.  
         | For more detailed information on how CSES codes parties/
         | coalitions, please see Part 3 of the CSES IMD Codebook.
         |
         | The harmonized and consistent codes for parties/coalitions are 
         | detailed in Part 3 of the CSES IMD Codebook. Users can search for 
         | the following term: "CSES IMD HARMONIZED PARTY/COALITION 
         | NUMERICAL CODES". 
         |
         | The corresponding variables to F6000_ in the CSES IMD are: 
         | F6000_PR_1:   IMD3002_PR_1
         | F6000_PR_2:   IMD3002_PR_2

         | F6000_LH_DC:  IMD3002_LH_DC

         | Codes are provided in F6000_LH_PL for parties that are assigned  
         | a harmonized IMD numeric party code by the CSES and for polities  
         | which are at least represented once in the CSES IMD. 
         | Parties that are not represented in the IMD and have thus not
