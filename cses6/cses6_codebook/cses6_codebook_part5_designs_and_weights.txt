))) CSES ADVANCE RELEASE - WHAT USERS NEED TO KNOW
===========================================================================

This dataset and all accompanying documentation is the "First Advance 
Release" of CSES Module 6 (2021-2026).

An Advance Release is a preliminary version of this CSES product. It thus 
lacks some of the checking, cleaning, processing, documentation, data, and 
variables that we anticipate in the Full Release of this product. The 
product is still in development, and data will be added gradually. Many 
election studies and variables that will eventually be present in the CSES 
Module 6 Full Release are unavailable in this file. Advance Releases are 
provided as a service to the CSES user community for those analysts who 
find it valuable to work with preliminary versions of the dataset. 

Users should anticipate future changes and improvements to the naming, 
data, and documentation of variables and election studies that appear in an 
advanced release file. If users wish to re-use their programming syntax/code 
on a future release of this product, we recommend that the code be written 
to accommodate these potential changes.

Users of the Advance Release may also wish to monitor the errata for CSES 
Module 6 on the CSES website to check for known errors that may impact their 
analyses. To view errata for CSES Module 6, go to Data Download on the CSES 
website, navigate to the CSES Module 6 download page, and click on the 
Errata link in the white box to the right of the page.

We hope that until the Full Release of CSES Module 6 is available, users 
will find this and future CSES Module 6 Advance Releases helpful in their 
work. 


===========================================================================
))) CSES DESIGN, DOCUMENTATION, & WEIGHTS - ADVICE TO USERS
===========================================================================

We recommend that researchers become familiar with the CSES design, units 
of analysis, documentation, and dataset weights before beginning their 
investigations. For instance, while the set of respondents appearing within
each election study represents their respective nations, the group of 
nations that appear within CSES is not a random sample of countries 
worldwide. Furthermore, while many election studies include 1,000 or so 
respondents, other election studies may consist of over 10,000 respondents. 
Some nations will have studies of more than one election in a CSES module,
and occasionally there will be two independent studies of a single 
election. Last, some election studies include oversamples of specific 
sub-populations or would otherwise benefit from use of the included weight
variables. We hope you find our website and documentation useful as you 
proceed with your work, and welcome any questions or suggestions you have.


===========================================================================
))) OVERVIEW OF "CODEBOOK PART 5: STUDY DESIGNS AND WEIGHTS"
===========================================================================

Part 5 of the CSES Codebook provides users with general information about
the design of each election study included in MODULE 6, as well as the 
original polity level weights for each study. 
 
The purpose of these overviews is to provide users with a quick summary 
of the study and the weights, including information about the sample size, 
the fieldwork period, sample selection procedures, the mode(s) of 
interview, and the language(s) the survey was administered in. 
 
For more detailed information about each study's design and its weights,
including information on response rates, refusal conversion, questionnaire
translation, respondent incentives etc., users are advised to consult 
the Design Reports for each polity included in the study which are 
available on the CSES MODULE 6 Study Page:  
(see https://cses.org/data-download/cses-module-6-2021-2026/). 


===========================================================================
))) HOW TO NAVIGATE THE CSES MODULE 6 CODEBOOK

>>> MODULE 6 QUESTIONNAIRE VERSION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Studies included in the CSES MODULE 6 fielded one of two versions of the
CSES questionnaire: the pilot questionnaire or the finalized questionnaire.
 
Variable F1024 "QUESTIONNAIRE VERSION" in the Dataset classifies for Users
the studies that fielded the pilot version of the questionnaire and the
finalized questionnaire. All studies in the current release fielded the
finalized questionnaire.
 
The differences between the pilot and finalized questionnaire will be
documented in the VARIABLE NOTES in CSES Codebook Part 2, once pretest
studies are integrated into the CSES MODULE 6 dataset.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> POLITY WEIGHTS IN CSES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSES provides users with up to three original weights from each 
national election study (see variable F1101_), namely:

  - SAMPLE WEIGHT (variable F1101_1): 
    intended to correct for unequal selection probabilities resulting from 
    booster samples procedures for selection within the household, 
    non-response, or other sample design features 

  - DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT (variable F1101_2): 
    intended to adjust sample distributions of socio-demographic 
    characteristics to more closely resemble the characteristics of the 
    population

  - POLITICAL WEIGHT (variable F1101_3): 
    intended to reconcile discrepancies in the reported electoral behavior
    of respondents vis-a-vis official electoral counts. 

Users are advised to read carefully about the different weights in CSES to 
ascertain whether their analyses should be subjected to weighting and if so 
which kind. The CSES project does not provide advice as to which weights 
are appropriate to use in particular circumstances. This is best left to 
analysts to decide based on their detailed knowledge of the research 
question under investigation. We advise analysts to consult each Polity's
Design Report on the CSES MODULE 6 Study Page (see
https://cses.org/data-download/cses-module-6-2021-2026/). 
For information on derivative weights calculated for the Cross-National 
Dataset, users should consult Parts 1 and 2 (variables F1101-F1105) 
of the CSES Codebook.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> DERIVATIVE WEIGHTS IN CSES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additionally to the original polity weights listed in the previous section
by national election study, CSES provides users with several derivative
weights, constructed from the original weights. They are: 
 
  - FACTOR WEIGHTS (variable F1102)
    These variables report the mean weight of each type, within each 
    polity. The resulting factors are then used to create the derivative 
    Polity Weights (F1103 explained below). 

  - POLITY WEIGHTS (variable F1103)
    These variables report standardized versions (with a mean of 1 within  
    the polity) of the original weights provided with the component 
    election studies, described in F1101. They are the ratio of each 
    weighting factor to the mean weight (F1102) of each type, calculated 
    within each polity.

  - SAMPLE SIZE ADJUSTMENT WEIGHT (variable F1104)
    This variable reports the ratio of the average sample size to each 
    election study sample. The resulting factor is then used to create the
    derivative Dataset Weights, F1105. 

  - DATASET WEIGHTS (variable F1105)
    These variables are intended for micro-level analyses involving the 
    entire CSES sample. Using the sample size adjustment (F1104), the 
    centered weights (F1103) are corrected such that each election study
    component contributes equally to the analysis, regardless of the 
    original sample size. 

Details of the calculation of the above derivative weights, including 
the precise STATA code used to create the weights, can be found in the 
variable notes for variables F1102, F1103, F1104, and F1105 in Part 2 of
the CSES MODULE 6 Codebook.     

Analysts are advised to read the weight documentation carefully to ensure
their analyses are weighted appropriately (if applicable). The CSES 
project does not provide advice as to which weights are appropriate to 
use in particular circumstances. This is best left to analysts to decide 
based on their detailed knowledge of the research question under 
investigation. We advise analysts to consult variable notes for F1102-F1105 
in Codebook Part 2 for more specific information on how the derivative 
weights were calculated for the Cross-National Dataset.

))) OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN & WEIGHTS BY POLITY & ELECTION YEAR
===========================================================================

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - AUSTRALIA (2022)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2022 Federal election in Australia occurred on Saturday, May 21, 2022.
Fieldwork for the Australian study began on May 23, 2022, two days after 
election day. Data collection was completed after 14 days, ending on June 5, 
2022. The study contains information from Australian adults aged 18 years 
or over who were enrolled on the electoral register, and eligible to vote. 
The only excluded group are prison inmates serving sentences below three 
years which would be eligible to vote. This represents 0.11% of the 
electorate.

The study, undertaken by Australian National University (ANU), was conducted
as part of wave 61 of the Social Research Center's Life in Australia panel. 
Members of the panel are Australian residents aged 18 years or more. 
A total of 4,338 active panel members were invited to participate in the
study, with 3,556 completing the interview. Of these 3,556 interviews, 287 
respondents were removed from the data because they were not citizens and 
therefore ineligible to vote, reducing the total sample size to 3,269 
observations. 
The survey was administered in English. The study used a mixed-mode 
approach, including both Internet and telephone (landline and cell) surveys. 
Respondents were initially contacted and recruited via their landline or 
mobile phone and offered to complete the questionnaire online. Still, they
could self-select into the alternative mode and complete the study via 
telephone if they were uncomfortable completing surveys over the Internet 
or if Internet access was problematic. Of the 3,269 respondents comprising
the CSES sample, 3,158 observations completed the survey online, while the
remaining 111 respondents were interviewed via telephone.

A dual-frame random digit dialing (RDD) sample design was employed to
undertake recruitment of the Life in Australia panel in 2016, with a 30:70
split between the landline RDD sample frame and a cell phone RDD sample
frame. An alternating next/last birthday method was used for the landline 
phone sample to randomly select respondents from households with two or more
people. For the cell phone sample, the individual who answered the call was 
the selected respondent. Only one member per household was invited to join 
the panel. Between May 2018 and September 2021, the panel was refreshed 
multiple times with new panelists. All respondents receive a small incentive
for joining the panel and another incentive for each survey they complete.
Further details on the panel are provided in the study's Design Report. 

<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS

The 2022 Australian Study provides a COMBINED SAMPLE and DEMOGRAPHIC 
WEIGHT. This weight adjusts for the unequal probability of selection. It is 
calculated based on a model-based approach that uses a model to "project" 
the responding sample to the population. The panel collects more than 20 
characteristics about respondents from which the final set of covariates 
selected for the model was: Adults in the household, age group by highest 
education, gender, language spoken at home, remoteness, and state. This set 
was chosen since it yielded a satisfactory between bias and efficiency, and 
contained a wide range of model covariates. To adjust for wave biases, the 
weights were further adjusted through the use of propensity scores. 
Whereas all non-citizens (287 respondents from overall 3,556 respondents) 
were dropped from the dataset for CSES Module 6, the weight calculation 
included these non-citizens. Collaborators note that their statistician,
who devised the weights, advised them to retain the weight calculated 
based on ineligible respondents as a weight excluding them would make 
negligible differences to analysis. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - BRAZIL (2022)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2022 Brazilian general elections were held on Sunday, October 2, 2022
(first round) with a second round of Presidential elections held on Sunday, 
October 30, 2022. The Brazilian Election Study was conducted between 
November 19 and December 4, 2022. Fieldwork lasted 16 days, starting 48 days
after the first round. Quaest collected data in face-to-face interviews
using an electronic questionnaire. 
Interviewing was conducted in Portuguese, with all Brazilian citizens aged
16 years old and older and registered to vote eligible to be interviewed. 
The total number of observations from the Brazil Study is 2,001.

The survey employed a multi-stage stratified random sample design. In the
first stage, municipalities, which constitute the primary sampling units
(PSUs), were selected through systematic PPS (Probability Proportional to
Size), based on the voting-age population. Prior to selection, 
municipalities were stratified by region and state. In total, 119 PSUs were
selected. In the second stage, census tracts within municipalities were
selected again by PPS. In the third and final stage, a fixed number of
respondents were selected from within each census tract by quota sampling
based on gender, age, education, and family income. Quotas were set in 
accordance with the latest numbers from the TSE 2018 (Superior Electoral
Court), the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics' (IBGE) national
household surveys from 2022 and 2021, as well as the latest census from 
2010. The households to be contacted within census tracts were chosen by
random walk. If the individual within the selected household matched the
quotas and the interview was successfully conducted, the interviewer, 
walking clockwise, was instructed to skip three households and approach the
fourth one. If the respondent was not available or did not fit the quota,
the interviewers would move to the next household.


<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS

The 2022 Brazil Study provides a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT. The weight corrects for
imbalances between the sample and the population regarding gender, age, 
education, household income, and region - based on official records of the
Superior Electoral Court 2022 and the IBGE-PNAD 2022 (Brazilian Institute
for Geography and Statistics). Calculations of the weight are based on
raking/iterative proportional fitting, using the package "anesrake" in the
statistical software R.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - DENMARK (2022)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2022 Danish general election took place on Tuesday, November 1, 2022, 
except for the Faeroe Islands, where respondents voted early on Monday, 
October 31, 2022, due to a regional holiday. 
Fieldwork for the 2022 Danish post-election study was conducted by Epinion
A/S between November 2, 2022 -one day after the election - and February 1,
2023 (lasting 92 days). The questionnaire was administered in Danish as an
online survey with the option to answer a paper-based mail-back 
questionnaire. The sample is meant to represent eligible voters in Denmark -
Danish citizens aged 18 and older who are registered to vote automatically
if they permanently live in Denmark. The total number of observations from
the Denmark Study is 1,549.

The study is based on a simple random sample drawn from the Danish person 
register ("CPR-register") wherein all Danish citizens and long-term 
inhabitants of Denmark must be registered. Hence, individuals were the 
primary sampling unit and had the same probability of being selected. 
Respondents were initially contacted personally via digital mail 
("Digital Post") with the survey being verified by a personal access coding
system - or by mail for those exempt from digital postal services. With few
exceptions, digital mail is mandatory for Danish citizens. Respondents 
initially not answering the web survey were mailed a paper questionnaire
as an alternative to the web survey. About 1% of the sample made use of this 
opportunity, with the rest answering the questionnaire online. 
To boost response rates, reminders and prompts have been employed through
various channels (digital post, letters, SMS, postcards). Further, 
collaborators conducted a lottery among all survey participants in which 
respondents could win gift cards worth 500 DKK.

The 2022 Denmark Study provides a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT and a COMBINED 
DEMOGRAPHIC and POLITICAL WEIGHT. The demographic weight corrects 
distributions in the sample to known socio-demographic population 
characteristics (joint distribution of age groups, region, gender, plus 
education). 
The political weight was created using raking and builds upon the 
demographic weight, additionally adjusting the sample according to vote 
choice in the 2022 Danish general election.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2022 French Presidential elections were held across two rounds. The
first round was held on Sunday, April 10, 2022, and the second round 
run-off held on Sunday, April 24, 2022. Interviewing for the French
election study began on April 28, 2022 (18 days after the first round of 
the Presidential elections) and continued until May 26, 2022 (total of
36 days). The survey was administered in French, via the Internet. The
total number of observations for the study is 1,575. 

The sample is representative of the voting-eligible population,
i.e., French citizens who were 18 years or older at the time of the 
election, and living in mainland France (excluding Corsica). 

Respondents for the French 2022 study were sampled from the ongoing ELIPSS 
panel ("Etude Longitudinale par Internet Pour les Sciences Sociales"). 
ELIPSS is an internet panel that was established in 2012, with two refresher
samples conducted in 2016 and 2020. Panelists are selected randomly and 
respond online every month to surveys designed by researchers. Further, they
are provided with a touchscreen tablet connected to the internet to 
participate ELIPSS surveys.
Respondents recruited in 2012 and 2016 were sampled from the 2011 and 2014
censuses, respectively. For the 2012 panel wave, participants were 
recruited via various modes, including postal, phone and face-to-face. The
2016 refresher sample was recruited entirely face-to-face. The second 
refresher sample conducted in 2020 originates from the 2018 Fideli database
(statistical database on housing and individuals based on fiscal 
administration data). Originally planned as face-to-face, this refreshment
phase had to be adapted to a multi-mode approach due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. By January 2021, the panel included 2,300 active participants. 
Variable F1100 in the CSES Module 6 datasets distinguishes between the three
panel samples respondents originate from (2012, 2016, 2020).

The 2022 French Election Study (FES 2022) was part of the wider ELIPSS panel
program, comprising a total of five rounds of questioning conducted from 
November 2021 to July 2022. The fourth round included the CSES Module 6 
survey questions. However, researchers are advised that demographics as 
envisaged by CSES were not collected as part of this fourth wave. Instead,
the respective demographic and socio-economic information were gathered 
through the regular annual ELIPSS demographic survey.

>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - MONTENEGRO (2023)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2023 Montenegrin election study covers the Presidential elections, held
on Sundays, March 19 and April 2, 2023, and legislative elections held on
Sunday, June 11, 2023. 
The post-election cross-sectional study was fielded between October 14 and 
October 30, 2023, with fieldwork starting 125 days after the legislative 
elections. The fieldwork was conducted by De Facto Consultancy based
in Podgorica, with surveys administered face-to-face in Montenegrin. 
The sample is meant to be representative of eligible Montenegrin citizens
aged 18 years or older registered to vote. Institutionalized persons were
excluded from the sampling frame (about 0.5 percent of the voting-eligible 
population). The total number of observations from the Montenegro Study is
1,200.

The study was conceptualized as a stratified multi-stage random sample 
with three stages in total. In the first stage, all polling stations were
mapped to three geographic regions, North, Center and South. These regions
reflect differences in population size, the distribution of ethnic groups,
geography, economic strength, and history within Montenegro. Polling 
stations inside the regions formed the primary sampling units (PSUs) as well
as the second level of stratification, as they were divided into three
groups according to their size. This proxies for the settlement size and the
urban-rural divide within the country, with bigger polling places being more
urban, and smaller polling places being more rural. Upon assigning all 
polling places across the resulting nine cells (three per region, and 
additionally three within each of the regions), PSUs were selected through
the Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) method.

The respondent selection within PSUs in the third and final stage followed a
predefined procedure. Specifically, interviewers were instructed to select
households by random walk, selecting every third house or household. Within
each household, respondents were selected from a pool of all voting-eligible
household members according to the last birthday method. The final sample
includes 15 interviews from each PSU.

The 2023 Montenegro Study provides a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT based on national 
census statistics from 2011, the latest available year. The demographic 
weight is composed of two separate weights, one adjusting for the four main
national groups (Montenegrins, Serbs, Albanians, and Bosniaks-Muslims), the
other adjusting for gender and age groups (18-34, 35-54, 55+). The weight
included in F1101_2 is a multiplication of the two individual weights.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2022 Portuguese legislative election took place on Sunday, January 30,
2022. The post-election study was administered between February 11 and 
March 7, 2022 (25 days in total), with interviewer-administered in-person
interviewing. Fieldwork was conducted by GfK Portugal, with questionnaires 
administered in Portuguese. The total number of observations from the 
Portugal Study is 1,010.

The sample is meant to be representative of individuals aged 18 years or
older residing in continental Portugal (mainland) and having the right to
vote in the 2022 Parliamentary elections. The two autonomous regions of 
Madeira and the Azores were excluded from the sample frame (5 percent of the 
eligible population). The same holds for institutionalized persons (less 
than 1 percent of the eligible population).

The study is based on a multi-stage stratified random sample. The sample was
stratified according to locality size ("habitat") and EU NUTS II regions; a 
hierarchical geocode standard subdividing the territories of EU member 
states. In the first step, the random selection of localities within each of
the NUTS II regions was carried out following the General Index of INE's 
Population Census, based on the sample matrix of NUTS II regions and 
habitat. In each designated locality, sample points were then again sampled 
randomly. Afterward, households were selected through random route. From 
within each household, the eligible adult who was the next to have birthday
was selected for the interview in the last step.

The 2022 Portugal Study provides a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT and a COMBINED 
DEMOGRAPHIC and POLITICAL WEIGHT.
The demographic weight (F1101_2) adjusts the sample to known population 
characteristics regarding gender, age, and educational attainment. 
Population estimates were taken from the 2011 Census. 
The political weight (F1101_3) is a combined weight that adjusts the sample
to match the 2022 legislative election results on top of the demographic
weight.

>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - TURKIYE (2023)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2023 Turkish general elections were held on Sunday, May 14, 2023 
(first round) with a second round of Presidential elections held on Sunday, 
May 28, 2023. The 2023 Turkish election study is a post-election 
cross-sectional study, with fieldwork starting 103 days after the 
first round of elections. Fieldwork was conducted between August 25, 2023 
and October 4, 2023 by Frekans Arastirma and the questionnaire was 
administered face-to-face in Turkish. The total number of observations from 
the Turkiye Study is 1,508.

The sample is designed to be representative of the Turkish voting age 
population (i.e., citizens aged 18 years or older). Institutionalized 
persons in prisons or hospitals and military personnel were excluded from 
the sampling frame (estimated to be less than 3% of the voting-eligible 
population). Further, the sample excludes the NUTS-II region TR63 covering
areas in the provinces of Hatay, Kahramanmaras, and Osmaniye (about 4% of 
the total eligible population). Collaborators note the region was excluded 
due to the earthquakes on February 6, 2023, which caused major devastation
in the area, impeding proper sampling and interviewing. 

The sample was realized as a stratified multi-stage random sample. NUTS-2 
regions, as given by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK), formed the 
basis for stratification. In the first step, the target sample of 1,500 
envisaged interviews was stratified according to each region's share of the
urban and rural population as published by the Supreme Electoral Council
following the Address-Based Population Registration System (ADNKS) records.
After determining the desired number of interviews, collaborators requested
household addresses from the Turkish Statistical Institute with a block size
of 150. Ten voting-eligible respondents were targeted from each block, and
no substitution was used. The probability-proportionate-to-size (PPS) 
principle was used in distributing the address blocks to the NUTS-2 regions.
Respondents within visited household addresses were selected according to a
lottery method and based on the reported number of eligible individuals in
each household. If, for any reason, the selected individual could not be
interviewed on the first visit, the same household was visited up to three
times until the interview was conducted successfully.

The 2023 Turkiye Study includes a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT. The weight adjusts 
the sample to the following known population distributions of gender, age, 
and educational attainment: Males and Females, eleven age groups (ranging 
from 18-21 to 65+) and six categories for education (ranging from "no formal
education" to "college graduate").
The resulting 132 cells (2 x 11 x 6) were filled with the respective 
respondents from within the sample. Afterward, the resulting distributions
were compared to the latest available 2022 population statistics from the
Turkish Statistical Institute. Demographic weights were then created based 
on identified differences across population and sample distributions.
