))) CSES ADVANCE RELEASE - WHAT USERS NEED TO KNOW
===========================================================================

This dataset and all accompanying documentation is the "First Advance 
Release" of CSES Module 6 (2021-2026).

An Advance Release is a preliminary version of this CSES product. It thus 
lacks some of the checking, cleaning, processing, documentation, data, and 
variables that we anticipate in the Full Release of this product. The 
product is still in development, and data will be added gradually. Many 
election studies and variables that will eventually be present in the CSES 
Module 6 Full Release are unavailable in this file. Advance Releases are 
provided as a service to the CSES user community for those analysts who find 
it valuable to work with preliminary versions of the dataset. 

Users should anticipate future changes and improvements to the naming, data, 
and documentation of variables and election studies that appear in an 
advanced release file. If users wish to re-use their programming syntax/code 
on a future release of this product, we recommend that the code be written 
to accommodate these potential changes.

Users of the Advance Release may also wish to monitor the errata for CSES 
Module 6 on the CSES website to check for known errors that may impact their 
analyses. To view errata for CSES Module 6, go to Data Download on the CSES 
website, navigate to the CSES Module 6 download page, and click on the 
Errata link in the white box to the right of the page.

We hope that until the Full Release of CSES Module 6 is available, users 
will find this and future CSES Module 6 Advance Releases helpful in their 
work. 


===========================================================================
))) CSES DESIGN, DOCUMENTATION, & WEIGHTS - ADVICE TO USERS
===========================================================================

We recommend that researchers become familiar with the CSES design, units 
of analysis, documentation, and dataset weights before beginning their 
investigations. For instance, while the set of respondents appearing within
each election study represents their respective nations, the group of 
nations that appear within CSES is not a random sample of countries 
worldwide. Furthermore, while many election studies include 1,000 or so 
respondents, other election studies may consist of over 10,000 respondents. 
Some nations will have studies of more than one election in a CSES module,
and occasionally there will be two independent studies of a single 
election. Last, some election studies include over samples of specific 
sub-populations or would otherwise benefit from use of the included weight
variables. We hope you find our website and documentation useful as you 
proceed with your work, and welcome any questions or suggestions you have.


===========================================================================
))) OVERVIEW OF "CODEBOOK PART 3: PARTIES & LEADERS"
===========================================================================

Part 3 of the CSES Codebook identifies the parties/coalitions participating 
during a polity's national election and/or those participating in the 
polity's previous national election. It also details the leaders of 
parties/coalitions and/or Presidential candidates (where applicable) 
for the most important parties/coalitions.
Part 3 also lists the party identifiers in other comparative projects, 
namely the Manifesto Research on Political Representation (MARPOR, formerly
the Comparative Manifesto Project) and Party Facts. This will allow easy
data bridging between CSES and these other projects.


===========================================================================
))) HOW TO NAVIGATE THE CSES MODULE 6 CODEBOOK
===========================================================================

In the CSES MODULE 6 dataset, all variables begin with the letter "F" 
(F being the sixth letter of the English alphabet and thus signifying 
MODULE 6).

The CSES codebook is especially extensive and users are advised that the 
best way to navigate it is electronically. It is a .txt format which 
allows it to be accessed via a variety of programs. 

The CSES Codebook can be navigated quickly in the electronic files, with 
the following commands allowing for quick searching:

))) = Section Header 

>>> = Sub-section Header 1

<<>> = Sub-section Header 2 

+++ = Tables

CSES QUESTION CLASSIFICATION = For survey level variables only, CSES  
Question Classification details whether the variable is part of the CSES  
Core component, which are questions asked repeatedly in CSES Modules, 
whether a variable is part of the CSES Module Theme component, which are  
questions specific to the Module Theme under exploration and might not be 
included in CSES repeatedly, or whether a variable is a Derivative Variable, 
which is explained below. 

VARIABLE NOTES = Notes for particular variables 

ELECTION STUDY NOTES = Notes for a particular election study  

DERIVATIVE VARIABLE = Highlights a variable derived from another 
variable or variables within the CSES.

POTENTIAL POLITY LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging at polity level.

POTENTIAL REGIONAL LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging at regional level.

POTENTIAL TIME BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging by time.

POTENTIAL PARTY/COALITION LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = Highlights a variable 
that may be used for data bridging at party/coalition level.

POTENTIAL CSES PRODUCT BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = Highlights a variable 
that may be used for data bridging with other CSES products.

For further details on the CSES MODULE 6 documentation, users are advised
to consult Part 1 of the CSES Codebook. 


===========================================================================
))) CSES MODULE 6 CODING OF PARTIES/COALITIONS & LEADERS
===========================================================================

CSES codes parties/coalitions in its dataset numerically and
alphabetically. Below we provide explanations of both of these coding
schemes. The details of each party/coalition/leader classification are 
available in Part 3 of the Codebook. 

<<>> CSES NUMERICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING

Each party is assigned a unique numerical code which consists of two 
components and six digits in total:
    - the first three digits indicate the numerical country UN code
    - the latter three digits indicate the numerical party code within
      the given election study.

All parties/coalitions or Presidential candidates, where applicable,
participating in the election or the previous election receive a numerical
code. These codes are used to identify the following: 
    - who a respondent voted for in the current election (variables F3011_).
    - who the respondent voted for in the previous election 
      (variables F3016_).
    - the respondent's party identification (variable F3023_3).
      
The numeric coding is also used to identify macro level information about
the parties/coalitions, namely: 
    - numeric party code identifiers for relational data (variables F5000_)
    - numeric party code identifiers for leaders' party affiliations
      (variables F5000_L_)   
    - which party/coalition held the Presidency before and after the
      elections (variable F5019_1 and F5019_2).
    - which party/coalition held the Prime Ministership before and after
      the elections (variable F5020_1 and F5020_2).
    - which party/coalition held the ministry of finance before and after
      the elections (variable F5023_1 and F5023_2).
    - which party/coalition held the foreign ministry before and after
      the elections (variable F5023_3 and F5023_4).
    - which party/coalition held the health ministry before and after
      the elections (variable F5023_5 and F5023_6).
     
Numerical codes assigned to parties/coalitions are consistent for the 
current and previous election.

<<>> CSES ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING
 
Parties A through F are the six most popular parties/coalitions, ordered in
descending order of their share of the popular vote in the parliamentary 
election (unless otherwise stated). Thus Party A is the party/coalition
that received the most votes in the election, party B the second most
votes, etc...

Parties/coalitions who achieve at least 1% of the vote nationally are
eligible for an alphabetical A-F assignment. In polities with multiple
electoral tiers and where one vote is cast, parties are ordered according
to their vote share in tier 1 (the lowest tier), unless otherwise stated.
In polities where voters have two votes (i.e.: a constituency and a list
vote) simultaneously, for example Germany, parties are ordered by the
national share of the party list vote (tier 2) unless stated otherwise.

Parties G, H, and I are supplemental parties. They may, but do not have to,
accord with how parties A-F are ordered, that is ordered on the popular 
share of the vote in a country. More often, they are codified in no 
particular order. These parties are voluntarily provided by each country's
election study and often reflect important or notable parties within a 
country. They may also include data about individual parties within a 
coalition, where data about the coalition and the individual parties, 
or some of these parties that make it up, are provided.
These codes are used to identify the following in the micro component of 
the CSES dataset: 
    - Respondent's likeability of the party/coalition (variable F3018).
    - Respondent's left-right placement of the party/coalition (variable 
      F3020).
    - Respondent's placement of the party/coalition on an alternative 
      scale, if applicable (variable F3021).

These alphabetical codes are used to identify district and macro level
information about these said parties/coalitions, namely:
    - The said party/coalition's vote share in the respondent's electoral
      district (variable F4004).
    - the said party/coalition's share of the seats in the election in the
      respondent's electoral district (variable F4005).
    - the said party/coalition's share of the vote in the election 
      (variables F5001, F5003, F5005, and F5006).
    - the said party/coalition's share of the seats in the election 
      (variables F5002 and F5004).
    - the said party/coalition's share of cabinet portfolios before and 
      after the election (variables F5021 and F5022).
    - expert judgments by the national Collaborators of the said party/
      coalition's ideological family (variable F5028).
    - expert judgments by the national Collaborators of the said party/
      coalition's left-right placement (variable F5029).
    - expert judgments by the national Collaborators of the said party/
      coalition's placement on an alternative scale, if applicable 
      (variable F5030).
    - expert judgments by the national Collaborators of the said party/
      coalition's level of populism (variable F5031).
    - The said party/coalition's Manifesto Research on Political 
      Representation (MARPOR/CMP) Identifier (variable F5200).
    - The said party/coalition's Party Facts Identifier (variable F5203). 

 
<<>> CSES ALPHABETICAL LEADER CODING
         
Leaders A through F tend to be the leaders of the six most popular parties/
coalitions or the Presidential candidates of these parties. They correspond
to parties A-F (i.e.: Leader A will be related to Party A in some way,
Leader B will be related to Party B, etc.).

Leaders G, H, and I are supplemental leaders. They may be related to
parties G, H, I but they do not have to be. These leaders are voluntarily
provided by each polities election study and often include data about
additional personalities of interest. For example, in a parliamentary
system, data about a President might be provided, even if the Presidency
is not being contested. On many occasions, slots Leader G, H, and I will
include additional data for parties/coalitions that have multiple leaders.
These codes are used to identify the following in the micro and macro
components of the CSES dataset: 
    - Respondent's likeability of the leader/personality in question
      (variable F3019).
    - the said leader/personality's biological sex (F5000_L_ABS-IBS).


===========================================================================
))) PARTIES AND LEADER CLASSIFICATIONS FOR CSES MODULE 6 BY POLITY &  
    ELECTION YEAR
===========================================================================

All parties/coalitions or Presidential candidates, where applicable, 
participating in the election or the previous election receive a 
numerical code. Alphabetical codes are assigned to select parties and 
leaders (see above description on how parties/coalitions and leaders are
coded by the CSES). 

The party/coalition and leaders are listed in numerical order. CSES 
provides the name of the party/coalition in the original language, the 
English version of the party/coalition name, and the party abbreviation, 
where available. Leaders are only listed for parties where we have 
accompanying leader likeability data available. Polities are listed in 
alphabetical order. The party/coalition and leaders are listed in numerical 
order. 

Users are advised to pay particular attention to ELECTION STUDY NOTES 
listed below each polity's party and leader list for additional information
regarding data availability and deviations.

         |
         | LEADER B, Jair Bolsonaro, was incumbent President and contested 
         | the 2022 election for the Liberal Party (LP, PARTY B). He joined 
         | the LP in 2021. However, researchers are advised that Bolsonaro
         | contested the previous 2018 elections as a member of the Social 
         | Liberal Party (PSL, NUMERICAL CODE 076033), a party he left in 
         | 2019. 
         |

))) PARTY IDENTIFIERS FROM OTHER COMPARATIVE STUDIES 
===========================================================================

For all parties/coalitions that are assigned an alphabetical classification
in CSES MODULE 6, CSES provides identifiers from two other comparative
projects, namely the Manifesto Research on Political Representation (MARPOR,
formerly the Comparative Manifesto Project, CMP) Project, and the Party 
Facts Database.
 
Below, we list the identifiers assigned by each project to a party/coalition
included in CSES MODULE 6 and which have been assigned an alphabetical
classification. This allows for data bridging between CSES MODULE 6 and
these datasets at the party/coalition level.
 
Data are listed in CSES Codebook Part 3 only for polities and
parties/coalitions where information is available in the accompanying
dataset. When unavailable for a polity or party/coalition, this is listed
in the CSES MODULE 6 dataset as "999999. NOT AVAILABLE IN MANIFESTO RESEARCH
ON POLITICAL REPRESENTATION PROJECT" or "9999. NOT AVAILABLE ..." for all
other projects. In the documentation below, when data is unavailable for a
particular party/coalition in a polity/study where data is mostly available,
it is listed as "999999" or "9999". In cases where data is unavailable for
all parties/coalitions for a particular polity/study, there is no
corresponding documentation entry below. 
 
Polities are listed in alphabetical order. Parties/coalitions are listed in
order of their A-I assignment in each polity. In circumstances where there
are multiple elections that are included in MODULE 6 for one polity,
parties/coalitions are first listed according to alphabetical assignment for
the first election study in question.
